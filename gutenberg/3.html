<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, 
as knowledge is of scepticism. To be content with what we at present 
know, is, for the most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since,
 from the very gradual character of our education, we must continually 
forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we
 must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we
 must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour
 and anxiety to acquire.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">And this difficulty attaches itself more 
closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over 
prejudice, and in which persons and things are, day by day, finding 
their real level, in lieu of their conventional value. The same 
principles which have swept away traditional abuses, and which are 
making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the 
thin, tawdry veil from attractive superstitions, are working as actively
 in literature as in society. The credulity of one writer, or the 
partiality of another, finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a
 chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of 
antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the impostures of 
pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition, whether of 
ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very different 
handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages 
could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives of 
the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his 
history, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and 
troublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large 
portion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less 
pertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, 
we must know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an 
induction of extended experience, is the best help to the criticism of 
human history. Historical characters can only be estimated by the 
standard which human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has 
furnished. To form correct views of individuals we must regard them as 
forming parts of a great whole—we must measure them by their relation to
 the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating 
the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed 
down to us, we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole 
narrative, than the respective probability of its details.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">1</span></span></a>
 have, perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of 
mankind than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the 
history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, 
which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or 
theories we will follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the 
only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without 
controversy; but upon everything else, even down to the authorship of 
plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we 
know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us
 to know. He was one of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">dramatis personae</span></span>
 in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears as the 
enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the 
writers who have handed them down. When we have read Plato <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">or</span></span>
 Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly 
read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse 
than ignorant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, 
of late years, to deny the personal or real existence of men and things 
whose life and condition were too much for our belief. This system—which
 has often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the 
consolations of Strauss for those of the New Testament—has been of 
incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present 
centuries. To question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a 
more excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact 
related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory developed
 from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same 
way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king 
whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">Numa Pompilius.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Scepticism has attained its culminating point 
with respect to Homer, and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be 
described as a free permission to believe any theory, provided we throw 
overboard all written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the
 Iliad and Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are 
summarily dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. 
“This cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, 
because it cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which 
testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to 
denial and oblivion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It is, however, unfortunate that the professed 
biographies of Homer are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity 
and imagination, in which truth is the requisite most wanting. Before 
taking a brief review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions, 
some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has
 been attributed to Herodotus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">According to this document, the city of Cumae 
in Æolia, was, at an early period, the seat of frequent immigrations 
from various parts of Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the 
son of Ithagenes. Although poor, he married, and the result of the union
 was a girl named Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age,
 under the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion 
of this maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was 
the first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of 
Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Boeotia, 
whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there
 lived at Smyrna a man named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music,
 who, not being married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and 
spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours. So 
satisfactory was her performance of this task, and so modest her 
conduct, that he made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a 
further inducement, willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would 
become a clever man, if he were carefully brought up.”</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">They were married; careful cultivation ripened 
the talents which nature had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed 
his schoolfellows in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled his 
preceptor in wisdom. Phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his 
property, and his mother soon followed. Melesigenes carried on his 
adopted father’s school with great success, exciting the admiration not 
only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the 
trade carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted
 to that city. Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the 
modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely 
found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and 
accompany him on his travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, 
but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was 
yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the 
countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his 
discourses.” Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron, 
“examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and 
informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met.” We 
may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of 
preservation.<a href="#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">2</span></span></a>
 Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here 
Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, 
and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical
 superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor. 
Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became 
acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed 
the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it 
was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their 
city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he 
applied himself to the study of poetry.<a href="#note_3" id="noteref_3" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">3</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having 
passed over the Hermaean plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New 
Wall, a colony of Cumae. Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained
 him the friendship of one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” 
continued the author, “the inhabitants showed the place where he used to
 sit when giving a recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured 
the spot. Here also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever 
since Melesigenes arrived”.<a href="#note_4" id="noteref_4" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">4</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">But poverty still drove him on, and he went by 
way of Larissa, as being the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say,
 he composed an epitaph on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, 
and with greater probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.<a href="#note_5" id="noteref_5" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">5</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">converzationes</span></span><a href="#note_6" id="noteref_6" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">6</span></span></a>
 of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. 
Encouraged by this favourable reception, he declared that, if they would
 allow him a public maintenance, he would render their city most 
gloriously renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the
 measure he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. 
Having made the speech, with the purport of which our author has 
forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting
 the answer to be given to his proposal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s demand, but one man observed that “if they were to feed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">Homers,</span></span>
 they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From 
this circumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of 
Homer, for the Cumans call blind men <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">Homers.</span></span>”<a href="#note_7" id="noteref_7" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">7</span></span></a>
 With a love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always 
been in its treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the 
poet vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumoea might never produce
 a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience 
another literary distress. One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation 
of poetical genius, kept Homer in his own house, and allowed him a 
pittance, on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name. 
Having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like 
some would-be-literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had
 sucked, and left him. At his departure, Homer is said to have observed:
 “O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, 
nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart.”<a href="#note_8" id="noteref_8" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">8</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Homer continued his career of difficulty and 
distress, until some Chian merchants, struck by the similarity of the 
verses they heard him recite, acquainted him with the fact that 
Thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the 
very same poems. This at once determined him to set out for Chios. No 
vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but he found one ready 
to start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he 
prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having 
embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able
 to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of 
hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a 
person who had known him in Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, 
after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met 
with an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our author. 
“Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of 
some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he 
cried out. Glaucus (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his 
voice, ran up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from 
Homer. For some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have 
reached such a place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He 
then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to 
desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. 
Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved 
him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having
 lit a fire, bade him sup.<a href="#note_9" id="noteref_9" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">9</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at 
the stranger, according to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed 
Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First 
give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better,
 since, whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the 
fold.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having finished supper, they banqueted<a href="#note_10" id="noteref_10" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">10</span></span></a> afresh on conversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">At length they retired to rest; but on the 
following morning, Glaucus resolved to go to his master, and acquaint 
him with his meeting with Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a 
fellow-servant, he left Homer at home, promising to return quickly. 
Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding his mate,
 he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid 
little attention to what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity 
in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade 
him bring the stranger to him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and 
bade him follow him, assuring him that good fortune would be the result.
 Conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness
 and general knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to 
undertake the charge of his children.<a href="#note_11" id="noteref_11" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">11</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Besides the satisfaction of driving the 
impostor Thestorides from the island, Homer enjoyed considerable success
 as a teacher. In the town of Chios he established a school where he 
taught the precepts of poetry. “To this day,” says Chandler,<a href="#note_12" id="noteref_12" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">12</span></span></a>
 “the most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, 
the School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city,
 northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on
 the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of
 the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual,
 sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The
 area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The 
whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of 
the most remote antiquity.”</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">So successful was this school, that Homer 
realised a considerable fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one 
of whom died single, the other married a Chian.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The following passage betrays the same tendency
 to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet, 
which has already been mentioned:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“In his poetical compositions Homer displays 
great gratitude towards Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he 
has inserted in his poem as the companion of Ulysses,<a href="#note_13" id="noteref_13" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">13</span></span></a>
 in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness. He 
also testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who had given him both 
sustenance and instruction.”</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">His celebrity continued to increase, and many 
persons advised him to visit Greece, whither his reputation had now 
extended. Having, it is said, made some additions to his poems 
calculated to please the vanity of the Athenians, of whose city he had 
hitherto made no mention,<a href="#note_14" id="noteref_14" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">14</span></span></a>
 he sent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met 
with him in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in 
celebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave 
great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon 
festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, 
with whose children he was very popular.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived
 at the island of Ios, now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. 
It is said that his death arose from vexation, at not having been able 
to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen’s children.<a href="#note_15" id="noteref_15" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">15</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Such is, in brief, the substance of the 
earliest life of Homer we possess, and so broad are the evidences of its
 historical worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them 
out in detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a 
persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of 
investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward 
statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and 
his works is lost in doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of 
the first minds who have done honour to humanity, because they rose 
amidst darkness. The majestic stream of his song, blessing and 
fertilizing, flows like the Nile, through many lands and nations; and, 
like the sources of the Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Such are the words in which one of the most 
judicious German critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in 
which the whole of the Homeric question is involved. With no less truth 
and feeling he proceeds:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“It seems here of chief importance to expect no
 more than the nature of things makes possible. If the period of 
tradition in history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in 
it perfect light. The creations of genius always seem like miracles, 
because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of 
observation. If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies,
 we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; 
for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret
 of the poet.” <a href="#note_16" id="noteref_16" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">16</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">From this criticism, which shows as much 
insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings
 of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at 
issue. Was Homer an individual?<a href="#note_17" id="noteref_17" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">17</span></span></a> or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there 
were twenty Homers; some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and 
foolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at 
last. We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our 
composure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth 
we least know what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for 
us is our admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I 
do.” <a href="#note_18" id="noteref_18" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">18</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">But, greatly as we admire the generous 
enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best 
impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the 
vividness of first impressions by minute analysis—our editorial office 
compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with 
which the Homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a 
brief period, to prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to 
condescend to dry details.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Before, however, entering into particulars 
respecting the question of this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of
 the Iliad,) I must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in
 the following remarks:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“We cannot but think the universal admiration 
of its unity by the better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive 
testimony to its original composition. It was not till the age of the 
grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is 
it injustice to assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a 
grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling, the 
comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite 
anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we 
would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and 
general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley 
Cooper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of Pope.—</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How parts relate to parts, or they to whole,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The body’s harmony, the beaming soul,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”<a href="#note_19" id="noteref_19" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">19</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Long was the time which elapsed before any one 
dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. 
The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to 
Apollo,<a href="#note_20" id="noteref_20" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">20</span></span></a>
 the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern 
critics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion
 touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,<a href="#note_21" id="noteref_21" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">21</span></span></a> and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names<a href="#note_22" id="noteref_22" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">22</span></span></a>
 it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal 
non-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems 
to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what 
are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts 
had begun to awaken on the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that 
“Homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, 
for small comings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of 
merriment. These loose songs were not collected together, in the form of
 an epic poem, till about Peisistratus’ time, about five hundred years 
after.”<a href="#note_23" id="noteref_23" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">23</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a
 similar scepticism on the subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of 
Battista Vico, that we first meet with the germ of the theory, 
subsequently defended by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. 
Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and 
with the following bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of
 Grote<a href="#note_24" id="noteref_24" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">24</span></span></a>—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable 
Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to account the Venetian Scholia, 
which had then been recently published, first opened philosophical 
discussion as to the history of the Homeric text. A considerable part of
 that dissertation (though by no means the whole) is employed in 
vindicating the position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst 
others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey 
had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable 
order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before 
Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no 
written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the 
earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without 
writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could 
have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, 
transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and 
convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long 
manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in 
Wolf’s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By
 Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one
 with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and
 it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient 
aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were
 written poems from the beginning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“To me it appears, that the architectonic 
functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates, in 
reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise admissible. But much would 
undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question, if it could be 
shown, that, in order to controvert it, we were driven to the necessity 
of admitting long written poems, in the ninth century before the 
Christian aera. Few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and 
Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits 
this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in
 the seventh century before the Christian aera, are exceedingly 
trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth 
Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; 
nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of 
Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and 
lyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time 
the practice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground 
which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, 
is in the famous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at 
the Panathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had 
existed, we are unable to say.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have 
been written from the beginning, rest their case, not upon positive 
proofs, nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to 
poetry—for they admit generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not 
read, but recited and heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there 
must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the 
unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. 
But here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; 
for the existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,<a href="#note_25" id="noteref_25" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">25</span></span></a>
 is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age 
essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable 
instruments and materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover, 
there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under 
no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for if
 such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification 
for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the 
example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of 
Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the
 general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The 
author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a 
blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been 
conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant 
reference to the manuscript in his chest.”</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The loss of the digamma, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">crux</span></span>
 of critics, that quicksand upon which even the acumen of Bentley was 
shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of 
the Greek language had undergone a considerable change. Now it is 
certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems could have 
suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved. If Chaucer’s
 poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have come 
down to us in a softened form, more like the effeminate version of 
Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“At what period,” continues Grote, “these 
poems, or indeed any other Greek poems, first began to be written, must 
be matter of conjecture, though there is ground for assurance that it 
was before the time of Solon. If, in the absence of evidence, we may 
venture upon naming any more determinate period, the question at once 
suggests itself, What were the purposes which, in that state of society,
 a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to 
answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; 
for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven
 with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions
 and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were 
required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could 
never reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to 
receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a
 solemn and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written 
Iliad would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men;
 a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which 
they had experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing
 the written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of 
the impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement 
may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, 
and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class 
existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first began to 
be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old 
epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may 
with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed 
the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the 
middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to 
B.C. 630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of 
Amorgus, &amp;c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated 
in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac 
and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the 
primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred 
from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a 
change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of 
publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the 
nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at the
 old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical
 effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be considered as 
desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual
 point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we 
are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the 
production of Homer. There seems, therefore, ground for conjecturing 
that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but very narrow 
class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics,—the 
Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to 
be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the 
opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about the same 
period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite 
papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would 
doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it; 
so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers 
and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a 
certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against
 the carelessness of individual rhapsodes.”<a href="#note_26" id="noteref_26" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">26</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to 
remain in possession of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force
 of the following observations—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c22">
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“There are several incidental
 circumstances which, in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the 
whole history of the Peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory,
 that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by
 the directions of the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who 
flourished at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have
 inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if 
Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task of 
compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange,
 to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible, that stronger 
marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain. Whatever occasional 
anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own
 ignorance of the language of the Homeric age, however the irregular use
 of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of 
Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair 
one herself among the heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have 
failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however, 
finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and 
distinguishing characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the
 language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting 
parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more 
ancient and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character 
with such a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an
 imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott 
has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“If, however, not even such 
faint and indistinct traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in 
the language of the poems, the total absence of Athenian national 
feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may 
fairly be suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than 
ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all the 
traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad, the 
Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part. Even the few 
passages which relate to their ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be 
interpolations. It is possible, indeed, that in its leading outline, the
 Iliad may be true to historic fact, that in the great maritime 
expedition of western Greece against the rival and half-kindred empire 
of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain of Thessaly, from his valour and 
the number of his forces, may have been the most important ally of the 
Peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on 
the Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the 
Athenians to yield to their taste. The songs which spoke of their own 
great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and popularity,
 or, at first sight, a Theseid would have been much more likely to have 
emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers of ancient song, than an 
Achilleid or an Olysseid. Could France have given birth to a Tasso, 
Tancred would have been the hero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the 
Homeric ballads, as they are sometimes called, which related the wrath 
of Achilles, with all its direful consequences, were so far superior to 
the rest of the poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still 
surprising, that throughout the whole poem the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c21">callida junctura</span></span>
 should never betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the 
national spirit of a race, who have at a later period not inaptly been 
compared to our self admiring neighbours, the French, should submit with
 lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own 
ancestors—or, at least, to the questionable dignity of only having 
produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age.”</span><a href="#note_27" id="noteref_27" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">27</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to
 be confessed, that Wolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the 
Iliad and Odyssey have never been wholly got over, we cannot help 
discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial 
point, and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, 
are rather augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is 
Lachmann’s<a href="#note_28" id="noteref_28" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">28</span></span></a>
 modification of his theory any better. He divides the first twenty-two 
books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as 
ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem 
belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus. This, as Grote
 observes, “explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative, but 
it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no contradictions 
warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets concur in 
getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the 
secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of 
the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the Halizonians; 
Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes again make 
their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that “it seems
 strange that any number of independent poets should have so 
harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.” The 
discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the 
fifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be 
regarded as the result of an interpolation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Grote, although not very distinct in stating 
his own opinions on the subject, has done much to clearly show the 
incongruity of the Wolfian theory, and of Lachmann’s modifications with 
the character of Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with 
equal success, that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of
 these poems, or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts 
by Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In 
short, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of 
pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the 
period of its first compilation.” The friends or literary <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">employes</span></span>
 of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and 
the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic 
“recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts 
they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of 
attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of 
the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, 
either in the Iliad or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying 
that term to the age of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view 
the alterations brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, 
the coined money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and 
republican governments, the close military array, the improved 
construction of ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual 
frequentation of religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of
 religion, &amp;c., familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations 
Onomakritus, and the other literary friends of Peisistratus, could 
hardly have failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for 
the first time, undertaken the task of piecing together many self 
existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything in the two great 
Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to an age two 
or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the 
interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are 
pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before 
Christ, and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some
 cases even by Arktinus and Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter.<a href="#note_29" id="noteref_29" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">29</span></span></a>
 As far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as external, 
enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and 
Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand (always allowing 
for partial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our 
first trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be
 added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most 
important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to 
Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the 
anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the 
subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive 
contrasts between their former and their later condition.”<a href="#note_30" id="noteref_30" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">30</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that 
the labours of Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, 
although, I must confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the 
extent of his labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the 
composition or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present 
form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine 
taste and elegant mind of that Athenian<a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">31</span></span></a>
 would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the 
poems, rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a 
fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting 
whether the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was
 known in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the 
more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">I cannot, however, help thinking, that the 
story which attributes the preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is 
little else than a version of the same story as that of Peisistratus, 
while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others
 relating to the Spartan Confucius.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric 
theories, with an attempt, made by an ingenious friend, to unite them 
into something like consistency. It is as follows:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c22">
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“No doubt the common soldiers
 of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some 
one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent music’ among them. Many of 
these, like those of the negroes in the United States, were 
extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them. But what was
 passing around them? The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; 
occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of 
former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive 
memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated 
accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the 
beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an 
intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an 
intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“It was at this period, about
 four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of
 Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that 
these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a
 poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he 
published these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem 
now exists, under the title of the ‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did 
not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of 
it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the 
ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, 
or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, 
than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as 
Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great
 poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one 
comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be 
competent to do so.’</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“While employed on the wild 
legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of 
Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized the hint that there 
presented itself, and the Achilleis</span><a href="#note_32" id="noteref_32" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">32</span></span></a> <span class="c19">grew
 under his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the 
poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed 
lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to 
the Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew 
that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; 
but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and 
corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets, 
assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then Peisistratus, and
 afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored the 
works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great 
measure.”</span><a href="#note_33" id="noteref_33" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">33</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Having thus given some general notion of the 
strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most 
interesting subject, I must still express my conviction as to the unity 
of the authorship of the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions 
and interpolations disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the 
poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than 
the negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious 
assumption, but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal, if we 
would either understand or enjoy these poems. In maintaining the 
authenticity and personality of their one author, be he Homer or 
Melesigenes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit,</span></span>
 I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of historical evidence is
 against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a 
plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that 
which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul, 
also speaks eloquently to the contrary.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from 
seeking to despise. Indeed, considering the character of some of my own 
books, such an attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I 
appreciate its importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set 
little store on its aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts 
of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, 
had they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he 
would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in 
laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often 
least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not 
poets by profession, but may be so <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">per accidens.</span></span>
 I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated 
to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of 
remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a 
thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be 
gloomy and jejune.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">But it is not on words only that grammarians, 
mere grammarians, will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome 
ingenuity. Binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon 
which they have previously dissected his words and sentences, they 
proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale, and 
inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful
 affiliation, they cut out book after book, passage after passage, till 
the author is reduced to a collection of fragments, or till those, who 
fancied they possessed the works of some great man, find that they have 
been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand. If we 
compare the theories of Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall 
feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the 
apocryphal position of Homer. One rejects what another considers the 
turning-point of his theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what 
another would explain by omitting something else.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any 
means to be looked upon as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar
 of no ordinary skill, seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that 
the tragedies attributed to Seneca are by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">four</span></span> different authors.<a href="#note_34" id="noteref_34" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">34</span></span></a>
 Now, I will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not
 only in their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers 
like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in 
their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an 
ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers
 of the present day would question the capabilities of the same 
gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great 
many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished 
the world with the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil, and 
the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to
 say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the 
refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this 
subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric 
theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather 
than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the 
literary history of more recent times will account for many points of 
difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so 
remote from that of their first creation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">I have already expressed my belief that the 
labours of Peisistratus were of a purely editorial character; and there 
seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not
 have been abroad in his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus 
and Tibullus should have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and 
others. But, after all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, 
that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry
 most powerfully appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The 
ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer,
 does too much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole 
soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To 
believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the 
powers of human invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense
 of the most ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in 
the contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in 
the very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a 
mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer
 as one that has nature herself for its mainspring; while I can join 
with old Ennius in believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some 
patron saint, hovers round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare 
gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could 
not exhaust,—still I am far from wishing to deny that the author of 
these great poems found a rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked 
mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and 
embellishment. But it is one thing to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">use</span></span>
 existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up 
the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style and 
execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad 
taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">A blending of popular legends, and a free use 
of the songs of other bards, are features perfectly consistent with 
poetical originality. In fact, the most original writer is still drawing
 upon outward impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of 
secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But
 unless there be some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most
 distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad
 can never come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes 
the most pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods 
and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in 
more substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to
 create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and 
embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a 
parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their 
wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will 
require little acuteness to detect.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Sensible as I am of the difficulty of 
disproving a negative, and aware as I must be of the weighty grounds 
there are for opposing my belief, it still seems to me that the Homeric 
question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has 
often obtained. We are not by nature intended to know all things; still 
less, to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have
 been placed at our disposal. Were faith no virtue, then we might indeed
 wonder why God willed our ignorance on any matter. But we are too well 
taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be 
especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most
 influence upon the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of 
sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good, which seems
 to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence
 into a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an 
homeopathic dynameter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to 
familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities; or rather, if we 
read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too 
much dazzled, too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell 
upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover. In reading an 
heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, 
we in imagination must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, 
burn with the same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if 
we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will 
scarcely suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems
 of Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest 
writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">And it was this supposed unity of authorship 
which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the 
men of old. Heeren, who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern
 theories, finely observes:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c22">
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“It was Homer who formed the 
character of the Greek nation. No poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a 
similar influence over his countrymen. Prophets, lawgivers, and sages 
have formed the character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to
 form that of the Greeks. This is a feature in their character which was
 not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy. When 
lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had already
 been accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior genius. He held
 up before his nation the mirror, in which they were to behold the world
 of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them 
reflected with purity and truth. His poems are founded on the first 
feeling of human nature; on the love of children, wife, and country; on 
that passion which outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs 
were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings 
of man; and therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every 
breast which cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his 
immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on 
earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations from the fields of 
Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain 
which his magic wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view 
the vast assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, 
which had been called into being by means of his songs; wherever his 
immortal spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his 
happiness.”</span><a href="#note_35" id="noteref_35" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">35</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of Homer”<a href="#note_36" id="noteref_36" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">36</span></span></a>
 is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much 
that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by 
the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more we read, 
and the more we think—think as becomes the readers of Homer,—the more 
rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this 
rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the means of its 
preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and 
eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre 
around which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only 
equalled by their inconsistency with each other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">As the hymns, and some other poems usually 
ascribed to Homer, are not included in Pope’s translation, I will 
content myself with a brief account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice,
 from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice<a href="#note_37" id="noteref_37" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">37</span></span></a>:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c22">
<p class="tei tei-p c20"><span class="c19">“This poem,” says Coleridge, 
“is a short mock-heroic of ancient date. The text varies in different 
editions, and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree; it 
is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of Homer’s genius; others
 have attributed it to the same Pigrees, mentioned above, and whose 
reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any 
piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain; so little did 
the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies, know or care about that 
department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of 
ancient writings. As to this little poem being a youthful profusion of 
Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it 
is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the general spirit, but of 
the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and even, if no such 
intention to parody were discernible in it, the objection would still 
remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary 
effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the 
development of national taste, which the history of every other people 
in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to be a law of 
the human mind; it is in a state of society much more refined and 
permanent than that described in the Iliad, that any popularity would 
attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem;
 and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind
 attributed, for aught we can see, with as much reason to Homer, is a 
strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the Homeric age. 
Knight infers from the usage of the word deltos, “writing tablet,” 
instead of diphthera, “skin,” which, according to Herod. 5, 58, was the 
material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this poem
 was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that the 
familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong argument against so 
ancient a date for its composition.”</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Having thus given a brief account of the poems 
comprised in Pope’s design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on 
his translation, and on my own purpose in the present edition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had
 been irregular, and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through
 the version of Ogilby. It is not too much to say that his whole work 
bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general 
sense, rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features 
of language. Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an 
elegant paraphrase than a translation. There are, to be sure, certain 
conventional anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various friends,
 whose classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the 
undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result 
rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire 
to make a perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is
 called literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If 
something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy 
gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a
 pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of
 the poet’s meaning, his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">words</span></span> were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a poem as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s 
translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text. We must
 be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work 
which is as much a part of English literature as Homer himself is of 
Greek. We must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old 
Iliad, that once was our most cherished companion, or our most 
looked-for prize, merely because Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made 
us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective, and not
 a substantive. Far be it from us to defend the faults of Pope, 
especially when we think of Chapman’s fine, bold, rough old English;—far
 be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of Homer
 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">might</span></span> be. But 
we can still dismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the 
consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books 
before they have read its fellow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">As to the Notes accompanying the present 
volume, they are drawn up without pretension, and mainly with the view 
of helping the general reader. Having some little time since translated 
all the works of Homer for another publisher, I might have brought a 
large amount of accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, 
to bear upon the text. But Pope’s version was no field for such a 
display; and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or 
mythological allusions, to notice occasionally <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">some</span></span>
 departures from the original, and to give a few parallel passages from 
our English Homer, Milton. In the latter task I cannot pretend to 
novelty, but I trust that my other annotations, while utterly 
disclaiming high scholastic views, will be found to convey as much as is
 wanted; at least, as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could
 be expected to admit. To write a commentary on Homer is not my present 
aim; but if I have made Pope’s translation a little more entertaining 
and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my 
wishes satisfactorily accomplished.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Homer is universally allowed to have had the 
greatest invention of any writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil
 has justly contested with him, and others may have their pretensions as
 to particular excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. 
Nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of 
poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry.
 It is the invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great
 geniuses: the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, 
which masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes
 art with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best 
but “steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on
 managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works 
of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the 
invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can 
only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure, 
which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more 
entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are 
inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and 
fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue 
their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to 
comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Our author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if
 we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, 
it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a
 copious nursery, which contains the seeds and first productions of 
every kind, out of which those who followed him have but selected some 
particular plants, each according to his fancy, to cultivate and 
beautify. If some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness 
of the soil; and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it
 is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger 
nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It is to the strength of this amazing invention
 we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so 
forcible in Homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of 
himself while he reads him. What he writes is of the most animated 
nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in 
action. If a council be called, or a battle fought, you are not coldly 
informed of what was said or done as from a third person; the reader is 
hurried out of himself by the force of the poet’s imagination, and turns
 in one place to a hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his 
verses resembles that of the army he describes,</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hoid’ ar’ isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito.</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“They pour along like a fire that sweeps the 
whole earth before it.” It is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, 
which is everywhere vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the 
beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour: it grows in the progress
 both upon himself and others, and becomes on fire, like a 
chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact disposition, just thought, 
correct elocution, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; 
but this poetic fire, this “vivida vis animi,” in a very few. Even in 
works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can overpower 
criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove. Nay, where this 
appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish 
about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. This fire is 
discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected from 
Homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant: in 
Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted 
flashes: In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour
 by the force of art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like
 an accidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns
 everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">I shall here endeavour to show how this vast 
invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through
 all the main constituent parts of his work: as it is the great and 
peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">This strong and ruling faculty was like a 
powerful star, which, in the violence of its course, drew all things 
within its vortex. It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole 
circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature, to supply his maxims 
and reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to 
furnish his characters: and all the outward forms and images of things 
for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, 
he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination, and created a 
world for himself in the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls 
“the soul of poetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin
 with considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I 
speak of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken 
for fiction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Fable may be divided into the probable, the 
allegorical, and the marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of 
such actions as, though they did not happen, yet might, in the common 
course of nature; or of such as, though they did, became fables by the 
additional episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main
 story of an epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the 
Trojans in Italy,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of 
Achilles,” the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any
 poet. Yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and 
events, and crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, 
battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those 
poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The 
action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole 
duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a
 genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as
 a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s 
poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The 
other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it 
so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of 
action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is
 it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his 
invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of 
story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up 
their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, 
Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) 
destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses 
visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent 
after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of 
Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be 
absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem, 
Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he 
gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the 
same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close 
imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the want
 from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking of 
Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from Pisander, as
 the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in 
Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we 
reflect upon those innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and 
physical philosophy which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up
 in his allegories, what a new and ample scene of wonder may this 
consideration afford us! How fertile will that imagination appear, which
 was able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qualifications 
of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms and persons, and to 
introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they 
shadowed! This is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute 
with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this 
head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle,
 but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of 
learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered in a 
plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to
 lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was 
no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that 
demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of 
furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The marvellous fable includes whatever is 
supernatural, and especially the machines of the gods. If Homer was not 
the first who introduced the deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the 
religion of Greece, he seems the first who brought them into a system of
 machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its greatest importance 
and dignity: for we find those authors who have been offended at the 
literal notion of the gods, constantly laying their accusation against 
Homer as the chief support of it. But whatever cause there might be to 
blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view, they are so 
perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to 
follow them: none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond 
the limits he has set: every attempt of this nature has proved 
unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, 
his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">We come now to the characters of his persons; 
and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible
 and surprising a variety, or given us such lively and affecting 
impressions of them. Every one has something so singularly his own, that
 no painter could have distinguished them more by their features, than 
the poet has by their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the 
distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and 
vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the 
several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and 
intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and 
subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector,
 active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of 
empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness
 for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in 
Sarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and 
astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which 
constitutes the main of each character, but even in the under parts of 
it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For
 example: the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; 
and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and 
various, of the other natural, open, and regular. But they have, 
besides, characters of courage; and this quality also takes a different 
turn in each from the difference of his prudence; for one in the war 
depends still upon caution, the other upon experience. It would be 
endless to produce instances of these kinds. The characters of Virgil 
are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie, in a great 
degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they are marked most 
evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer. His characters 
of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar, 
but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that differences
 the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the 
rest. In like manner it may be remarked of Statius’s heroes, that an air
 of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage 
courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a
 parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I 
believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he will
 pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced how
 infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that 
of all others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The speeches are to be considered as they flow 
from the characters; being perfect or defective as they agree or 
disagree with the manners, of those who utter them. As there is more 
variety of characters in the Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any
 other poem. “Everything in it has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), 
that is, everything is acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work
 of such length, how small a number of lines are employed in narration. 
In Virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and 
the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which 
might be equally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As 
many of his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches
 escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener 
think of the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are 
engaged in Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that 
interests us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and 
Virgil leaves us readers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">If, in the next place, we take a view of the 
sentiments, the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and 
spirit of his thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in 
this part Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to 
prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that
 they have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, 
in his Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this 
sort. And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if 
Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so 
many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises 
into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">If we observe his descriptions, images, and 
similes, we shall find the invention still predominant. To what else can
 we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort, where we 
see each circumstance of art, and individual of nature, summoned 
together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all 
things, in their various views presented themselves in an instant, and 
had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not 
only gives us the full prospects of things, but several unexpected 
peculiarities and side views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. 
Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles, which take 
up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety 
of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another; such different 
kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and 
such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last 
in greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near 
that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every 
one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is 
evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which 
are not drawn from his master.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">If we descend from hence to the expression, we 
see the bright imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened 
forms of it. We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the 
first who taught that “language of the gods” to men. His expression is 
like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be 
laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest
 and most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit. 
Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out 
“living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than 
in any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing, a
 weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet his 
expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in 
proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the 
diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same
 degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as 
that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in 
the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a 
greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the 
heat more intense.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">To throw his language more out of prose, Homer 
seems to have affected the compound epithets. This was a sort of 
composition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heightened the 
diction, but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound 
and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images. 
On this last consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the 
fruitfulness of his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a
 sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they 
were joined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet 
Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos, 
and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted 
upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a single
 line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal action 
or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets is a 
short description.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Lastly, if we consider his versification, we 
shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that
 also. He was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in 
any one part of Greece, but searched through its different dialects with
 this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered
 these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and 
accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater 
smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has a
 peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its 
custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make the
 words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency. With 
this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the 
feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its 
accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the 
licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his 
sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his 
rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in 
the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all 
these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only
 the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so great a 
truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses, even 
without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we daily 
see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more sweetness, 
variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of poetry. The
 beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but 
faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to ascribe it to 
the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some advantages 
both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and cadence of 
its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language. Virgil was 
very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working up a 
more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of, and, 
in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his line to a 
beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so 
frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is, 
that fewer critics have understood one language than the other. 
Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author’s beauties
 in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices 
at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, 
as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as 
fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force 
and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a
 trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and 
always full; while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid,
 and yet the most smooth imaginable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, 
what principally strikes us is his invention. It is that which forms the
 character of each part of his work; and accordingly we find it to have 
made his fable more extensive and copious than any other, his manners 
more lively and strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and 
transported, his sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and 
descriptions more full and animated, his expression more raised and 
daring, and his numbers more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been
 said of Virgil, with regard to any of these heads, I have no way 
derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than 
the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of 
particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their
 merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge of the 
principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that
 we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are 
to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in more than
 one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in 
judgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because 
Virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention,
 because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great 
authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said
 to have less in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater 
genius, Virgil the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the 
other the work. Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding 
impetuosity; Virgil leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters 
with a generous profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; 
Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; 
Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. 
When we behold their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes
 they celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all 
before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, 
calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the 
action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And when
 we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his 
terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the 
heavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling 
with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his 
whole creation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">But after all, it is with great parts, as with 
great virtues, they naturally border on some imperfection; and it is 
often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault 
begins. As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great 
judgment decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion
 or extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If
 we look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections
 against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this 
faculty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Among these we may reckon some of his 
marvellous fictions, upon which so much criticism has been spent, as 
surpassing all the bounds of probability. Perhaps it may be with great 
and superior souls, as with gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves 
with unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due 
proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and, like the old 
heroes of that make, commit something near extravagance, amidst a series
 of glorious and inimitable performances. Thus Homer has his “speaking 
horses;” and Virgil his “myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has
 not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the 
probability.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It is owing to the same vast invention, that 
his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. 
The force of this faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability
 to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison
 is grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, 
which, however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His 
similes are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its 
proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with 
occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his manner
 of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when his 
fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images.
 The reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of 
the same kind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">If there are others which seem rather to charge
 him with a defect or narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those 
seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from 
the nature of the times he lived in. Such are his grosser 
representations of the gods; and the vicious and imperfect manners of 
his heroes; but I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a point
 generally carried into extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of
 Homer. It must be a strange partiality to antiquity, to think with 
Madame Dacier, <a href="#note_38" id="noteref_38" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">38</span></span></a>
 “that those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they 
are more contrary to ours.” Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as 
to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and 
cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned through
 the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre; when the 
greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and daughters 
made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be so 
delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile offices
 and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of Homer 
engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity, in 
opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs 
without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses 
drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect 
that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and 
those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the 
perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations 
and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three 
thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining 
themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to 
be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means 
alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates 
their dislike, will become a satisfaction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">This consideration may further serve to answer 
for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such 
as the “far-darting Phoebus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed 
Achilles,” &amp;c., which some have censured as impertinent, and 
tediously repeated. Those of the gods depended upon the powers and 
offices then believed to belong to them; and had contracted a weight and
 veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used:
 they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion 
to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to 
omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, 
that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such; for the 
Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add 
some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents 
expressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander 
the son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, 
&amp;c. Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used
 such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, 
we have something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names 
of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black
 Prince, &amp;c. If yet this be thought to account better for the 
propriety than for the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. 
Hesiod, dividing the world into its different ages, has placed a fourth 
age, between the brazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other
 men; a divine race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods,
 and live by the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.” Now 
among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also
 in common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of 
an epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their
 families, actions or qualities.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">What other cavils have been raised against 
Homer, are such as hardly deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice 
of as they occur in the course of the work. Many have been occasioned by
 an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if
 one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the 
foundation: one would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, 
that these critics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written 
first; a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to 
have always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they 
overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral
 of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which might 
set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man, and 
the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the 
other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed; as 
because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when the 
very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus that 
Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select those 
particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some that 
Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger in his
 Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean 
expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener 
from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in the
 awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of Perrault 
in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a fairer 
proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and that of
 his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great 
reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times, 
and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of this 
principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the 
cities, &amp;c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the
 consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or
 any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many 
casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la 
Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had 
lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he 
may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed 
him.<a href="#note_39" id="noteref_39" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">39</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">In all these objections we see nothing that 
contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention: and as long 
as this (which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself) remains 
unequalled by his followers, he still continues superior to them. A 
cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the 
eyes of one sort of critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the 
loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader 
under the strongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of 
poetry, but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has
 swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done 
admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation. 
He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some
 of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work of 
this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most vigorous 
seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the finest 
fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join to 
make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have only said 
that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature, 
might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Having now spoken of the beauties and defects 
of the original, it remains to treat of the translation, with the same 
view to the chief characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main 
parts of the poem, such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no 
translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As 
it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and simile, 
whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief 
character. It is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his 
author entire and unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and 
versification only are his proper province, since these must be his own,
 but the others he is to take as he finds them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It should then be considered what methods may 
afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the 
Greek. It is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent 
original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to imagine 
(as many have done) that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this 
general defect; which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an 
ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expression. If there be
 sometimes a darkness, there is often a light in antiquity, which 
nothing better preserves than a version almost literal. I know no 
liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary to 
transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the poetical 
style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there have not been
 more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to the 
letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope of
 raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted, that the 
fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it 
is most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way 
to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without 
endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular 
place. It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and 
when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we 
will but follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and
 lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and 
humble, we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of 
incurring the censure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to 
Homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of 
his style: some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a 
proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold 
and timorous notion of simplicity. Methinks I see these different 
followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after him by violent 
leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and 
servilely creeping in his train, while the poet himself is all the time 
proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of
 the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no 
author is to be envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that 
character of style, which his friends must agree together to call 
simplicity, and the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a 
graceful and dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; 
which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that
 of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be 
dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and 
rusticity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in 
such perfection as in the Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with
 all respect to the inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use 
of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that 
time, and in that part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest
 to those, his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the 
sacred books than that of any other writer. This consideration (together
 with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may,
 methinks, induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several 
of those general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a
 veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament; 
as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the 
Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">For a further preservation of this air of 
simplicity, a particular care should be taken to express with all 
plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so 
numerous in this poet. They have something venerable, and as I may say, 
oracular, in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are 
delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give 
them what we call a more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the 
paraphrase.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old 
words after the manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, 
might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which
 most of any other seems to require a venerable, antique cast. But 
certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, such as 
“platoon, campaign, junto,” or the like, (into which some of his 
translators have fallen) cannot be allowable; those only excepted 
without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living 
language.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction,
 which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye 
distinguishes him at first sight; those who are not his greatest 
admirers look upon them as defects, and those who are, seemed pleased 
with them as beauties. I speak of his compound epithets, and of his 
repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done literally into English 
without destroying the purity of our language. I believe such should be 
retained as slide easily of themselves into an English compound, without
 violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as
 those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best 
poets, and are become familiar through their use of them; such as “the 
cloud-compelling Jove,” &amp;c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as 
fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded 
one, the course to be taken is obvious.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve 
their full image by one or two words, may have justice done them by 
circumlocution; as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear
 little or ridiculous translated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords a
 majestic idea in the periphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving
 woods.” Others that admit of different significations, may receive an 
advantage from a judicious variation, according to the occasions on 
which they are introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, 
hekaebolos or “far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one 
literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the 
other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in 
such places where Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use 
the former interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are 
described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be
 necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which
 we find in Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has 
been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to 
ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they 
derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are 
employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show his 
fancy and his judgment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">As for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them 
into three sorts: of whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences,
 and of one verse or hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have 
such a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the author
 on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other. The 
repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the
 speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the 
messages from gods to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in 
concerns of state, or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require 
it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I
 believe the best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at
 which the repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too 
close, one may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a 
professed translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the 
author is to answer for it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It only remains to speak of the versification. 
Homer (as has been said) is perpetually applying the sound to the sense,
 and varying it on every new subject. This is indeed one of the most 
exquisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of
 Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am 
sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is 
warm, and fully possessed of his image: however, it may reasonably be 
believed they designed this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a
 superior degree to all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of
 it: but those who have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly 
incapable of doing justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but 
that which one may entertain without much vanity, of giving a more 
tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done.
 We have only those of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken 
the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which,
 there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has
 frequent interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the
 thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty 
verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one 
might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of his
 notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a 
strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author; 
insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries 
he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the 
obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a 
fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the 
tragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &amp;c. In a word, the nature of the man may
 account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and
 remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.
 His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen 
weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that 
which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover his
 defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which 
is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ 
before he arrived at years of discretion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of 
the sense in general; but for particulars and circumstances he 
continually lops them, and often omits the most beautiful. As for its 
being esteemed a close translation, I doubt not many have been led into 
that error by the shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following
 the original line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. 
He sometimes omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then 
guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have 
fallen, but through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby’s, is 
too mean for criticism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">It is a great loss to the poetical world that 
Mr. Dryden did not live to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the 
first book, and a small part of the sixth; in which if he has in some 
places not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it
 ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in.
 He seems to have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he 
sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him in passages where he 
wanders from the original. However, had he translated the whole work, I 
would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of
 whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited
 translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is 
like that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in 
the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only 
for being at the head of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">That which, in my opinion, ought to be the 
endeavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep 
alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character: in 
particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the 
strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to 
copy him in all the variations of his style, and the different 
modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the more active or 
descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or 
narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and 
perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect 
even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very 
cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs 
of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter 
compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably 
preserved either the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to 
him is, to study his author rather from his own text, than from any 
commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in 
the estimation of the world; to consider him attentively in comparison 
with Virgil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the 
moderns. Next these, the Archbishop of Cambray’s Telemachus may give him
 the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu’s 
admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and
 conduct. But after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may 
proceed, or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, he must 
hope to please but a few; those only who have at once a taste of poetry,
 and competent learning. For to satisfy such a want either, is not in 
the nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing
 that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">What I have done is submitted to the public; 
from whose opinions I am prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so 
little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of this 
task. As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may give
 me some concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant
 writers. I was guided in this translation by judgments very different 
from theirs, and by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an 
old observation be true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is 
that of fools to men of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice 
determined me to undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me 
upon that occasion in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I 
was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my 
undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that 
warmth with which he always serves his friend. The humanity and 
frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any 
occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many 
friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who 
had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. I must add the 
names of Mr. Rowe, and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further 
opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good nature (to give it a
 great panegyric), is no less extensive than his learning. The favour of
 these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so 
true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the great
 have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my 
subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of 
learning as my chief encouragers? Among these it is a particular 
pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who have
 done most honour to the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of 
Buckingham was not displeased I should undertake the author to whom he 
has given (in his excellent Essay), so complete a praise:</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Read Homer once, and you can read no more;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For all books else appear so mean, so poor,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Verse will seem prose: but still persist to read,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Homer will be all the books you need.”</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first 
to favour me; of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the 
polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example: that such a 
genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great 
scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of 
learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the 
patron of their writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of 
“Heroic Love” has continued his partiality to me, from my writing 
pastorals to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of 
confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for 
the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of 
this translation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">I could say a great deal of the pleasure of 
being distinguished by the Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to
 particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a
 continued series of them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state,
 will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote
 this affair. The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late 
Lord Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of 
his friendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several 
others of my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered 
unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am 
satisfied I can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my 
silence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">In short, I have found more patrons than ever 
Homer wanted. He would have thought himself happy to have met the same 
favour at Athens that has been shown me by its learned rival, the 
University of Oxford. And I can hardly envy him those pompous honours he
 received after death, when I reflect on the enjoyment of so many 
agreeable obligations, and easy friendships, which make the satisfaction
 of life. This distinction is the more to be acknowledged, as it is 
shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular 
parties, or the vanities of particular men. Whatever the success may 
prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in which I have 
experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit; and 
in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally 
lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to 
others, nor disagreeable to myself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked 
some of the neighbouring towns, and taken from thence two beautiful 
captives, Chryseis and Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the
 last to Achilles. Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of 
Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action 
of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege. The priest being 
refused, and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance 
from his god; who inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a 
council, and encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who 
attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis. The king, being obliged to 
send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, 
which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command of the 
army, he seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws 
himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to 
Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong 
done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her
 suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are 
reconciled by the address of Vulcan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in 
this book: nine during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the
 princes, and twelve for Jupiter’s stay with the Æthiopians, at whose 
return Thetis prefers her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, 
then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.</p>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis time to save the few remains of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.<a href="#note_53" id="noteref_53" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">53</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The past, the present, and the future knew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Uprising slow, the venerable sage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would’st thou know</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First give thy faith, and plight a prince’s word</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Instruct a monarch where his error lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For though we deem the short-lived fury past,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom Pelides:—“From thy inmost soul</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Speak what thou know’st, and speak without control.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">E’en by that god I swear who rules the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not e’en the chief by whom our hosts are led,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo’s vengeance for his injured priest.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor will the god’s awaken’d fury cease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till the great king, without a ransom paid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.<a href="#note_54" id="noteref_54" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">54</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The priest may pardon, and the god may spare.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch started from his shining throne;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black choler fill’d his breast that boil’d with ire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his eye-balls flash’d the living fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this are Phoebus’ oracles explored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this with falsehood is my honour stain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heavenly charms prefer to proffer’d gold?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A maid, unmatch’d in manners as in face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d in each art, and crown’d with every grace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra’s charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When first her blooming beauties bless’d my arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our cares are only for the public weal:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let me be deem’d the hateful cause of all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And suffer, rather than my people fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So dearly valued, and so justly mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But since for common good I yield the fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My private loss let grateful Greece repair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That he alone has fought and bled in vain.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Would’st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The due reward of many a well-fought field?</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We share with justice, as with toil we gain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But to resume whate’er thy avarice craves</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whene’er, by Jove’s decree, our conquering powers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the king: “Shall I my prize resign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tame content, and thou possess’d of thine?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Think not to rob me of a soldier’s right.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At thy demand shall I restore the maid?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First let the just equivalent be paid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as a king might ask; and let it be</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or grant me this, or with a monarch’s claim</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This hand shall seize some other captive dame.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses’ spoils, or even thy own, be mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The man who suffers, loudly may complain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But this when time requires.—It now remains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa’s shores,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Tremendous oath! inviolate to kings);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By this I swear:—when bleeding Greece again</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain.</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To calm their passion with the words of age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow from his seat arose the Pylian sage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skill’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill’d:<a href="#note_58" id="noteref_58" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">58</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two generations now had pass’d away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two ages o’er his native realm he reign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the example of the third remain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All view’d with awe the venerable man;</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What shame, what woe is this to Greece! what joy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Troy’s proud monarch, and the friends of Troy!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That adverse gods commit to stern debate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best, the bravest, of the Grecian state.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor think your Nestor’s years and wisdom vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A godlike race of heroes once I knew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as no more these aged eyes shall view!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lives there a chief to match Pirithous’ fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dryas the bold, or Ceneus’ deathless name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Theseus, endued with more than mortal might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or Polyphemus, like the gods in fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With these of old, to toils of battle bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In early youth my hardy days I led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And smit with love of honourable deeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters’ gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Nestor spoke, they listen’d and obey’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If in my youth, even these esteem’d me wise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, awful majesty exalts above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let both unite with well-consenting mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shall authority with strength be join’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles’ rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbid it, gods! Achilles should be lost,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pride of Greece, and bulwark of our host.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But that imperious, that unconquer’d soul,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No laws can limit, no respect control.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his pride must his superiors fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His word the law, and he the lord of all?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What king can bear a rival in his sway?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here on the monarch’s speech Achilles broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Tyrant, I well deserved thy galling chain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should I submit to each unjust decree:—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Command thy vassals, but command not me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seize on Briseis, whom the Grecians doom’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seize secure; no more Achilles draws</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His conquering sword in any woman’s cause.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods command me to forgive the past:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let this first invasion be the last:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles with Patroclus took his way</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime Atrides launch’d with numerous oars</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A well-rigg’d ship for Chrysa’s sacred shores:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the deck was fair Chryseis placed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The host to expiate next the king prepares,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bulls and goats to Phoebus’ altars paid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sable fumes in curling spires arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And waft their grateful odours to the skies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The army thus in sacred rites engaged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides still with deep resentment raged.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To wait his will two sacred heralds stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Talthybius and Eurybates the good.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Haste to the fierce Achilles’ tent (he cries),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize:</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unwilling heralds act their lord’s commands;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At awful distance long they silent stand,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perceived, and thus with accent mild began:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chryseis last descending on the strand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her, thus returning from the furrow’d main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses led to Phoebus’ sacred fane;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where at his solemn altar, as the maid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hail, reverend priest! to Phoebus’ awful dome</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A suppliant I from great Atrides come:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unransom’d, here receive the spotless fair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And may thy god who scatters darts around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound.”<a href="#note_67" id="noteref_67" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">67</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this, the sire embraced the maid again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then near the altar of the darting king,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With water purify their hands, and take</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred offering of the salted cake;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose power incircles Cilla the divine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish’d rays!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If, fired to vengeance at thy priest’s request,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And smile propitious, and unbend thy bow.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Chryses pray’d. Apollo heard his prayer:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between their horns the salted barley threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:<a href="#note_68" id="noteref_68" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">68</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thighs, selected to the gods, divide:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On these, in double cauls involved with art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The choicest morsels lay from every part.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The priest himself before his altar stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And burns the offering with his holy hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youth with instruments surround the fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then spread the tables, the repast prepare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now the rage of hunger was repress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With pure libations they conclude the feast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youths with wine the copious goblets crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around;<a href="#note_69" id="noteref_69" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">69</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The paeans lengthen’d till the sun descends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo listens, and approves the song.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till rosy morn had purpled o’er the sky:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supplied by Phoebus, fill the swelling sails;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The parted ocean foams and roars below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above the bounding billows swift they flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till now the Grecian camp appear’d in view.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far on the beach they haul their bark to land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then part, where stretch’d along the winding bay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But raging still, amidst his navy sat</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor mix’d in combat, nor in council join’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Twelve days were past, and now the dawning light</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods had summon’d to the Olympian height:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leads the long order of ethereal powers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, like the morning-mist in early day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to the seats divine her flight address’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, far apart, and high above the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“If e’er, O father of the gods! (she said)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My words could please thee, or my actions aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some marks of honour on my son bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pay in glory what in life you owe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fame is at least by heavenly promise due</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To life so short, and now dishonour’d too.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Avenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till the proud king and all the Achaian race</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace.”</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred counsels of his breast conceal’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so repulsed, the goddess closer press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still grasp’d his knees, and urged the dear request.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">

<div class="tei tei-l c16">While I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,<a href="#note_70" id="noteref_70" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">70</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove to his starry mansions in the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining synod of the immortals wait</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coming god, and from their thrones of state</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arising silent, wrapp’d in holy fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the majesty of heaven appear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling they stand, while Jove assumes the throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, but the god’s imperious queen alone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Late had she view’d the silver-footed dame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all her passions kindled into flame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Say, artful manager of heaven (she cries),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain the partner of imperial state.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What favourite goddess then those cares divides,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To this the thunderer: “Seek not thou to find</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in the close recesses of my soul.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the sire the goddess of the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roll’d the large orbs of her majestic eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus return’d:—“Austere Saturnius, say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all thy counsels take the destined course.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ’tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In close consult, the silver-footed queen.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What fatal favour has the goddess won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To grace her fierce, inexorable son?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glut his vengeance with my people slain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the god: “O restless fate of pride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let this suffice: the immutable decree</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No force can shake: what is, that ought to be.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Goddess, submit; nor dare our will withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But dread the power of this avenging hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The united strength of all the gods above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove.”</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK II.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis,
 sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army 
to battle, in order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of 
Achilles. The general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy 
without his assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his 
absence, and the late plague, as well as by the length of time, 
contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem. He first 
communicates his design to the princes in council, that he would propose
 a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if 
the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon 
moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to 
prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who 
chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several 
speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor 
followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to 
divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle.
 This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the 
Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The time employed in this book consists not 
entirely of one day. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the 
sea-shore; towards the end it removes to Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now pleasing sleep had seal’d each mortal eye,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortals slumber’d on their thrones above;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.<a href="#note_76" id="noteref_76" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">76</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To honour Thetis’ son he bends his care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus commands the vision of the night.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,<a href="#note_77" id="noteref_77" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">77</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Agamemnon’s ample tent repair.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To move the troops to measure back the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be mine; and yours the province to detain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pour’d forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er the vale descends the living cloud.<a href="#note_81" id="noteref_81" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">81</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen’d train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spreads all the beach, and wide o’ershades the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the region runs a deafening sound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fame flies before the messenger of Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shining soars, and claps her wings above.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud<a href="#note_82" id="noteref_82" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">82</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch’s will, suspend the listening crowd.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of kings his awful figure raised:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Vulcan form’d, from Jove to Hermes came.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Pelops he the immortal gift resign’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Atreus’ hand, which not with Atreus ends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the mark of Agamemnon’s reign,</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On this bright sceptre now the king reclined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And artful thus pronounced the speech design’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader’s care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of partial Jove with justice I complain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heavenly oracles believed in vain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A safe return was promised to our toils,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Renown’d, triumphant, and enrich’d with spoils.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shameful flight alone can save the host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At whose command whole empires rise or fall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He shakes the feeble props of human trust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And towns and armies humbles to the dust.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh, lasting shame in every future age!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So small their number, that if wars were ceased,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Greece triumphant held a general feast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All rank’d by tens, whole decades when they dine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.<a href="#note_84" id="noteref_84" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">84</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But other forces have our hopes o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy prevails by armies not her own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since first the labours of this war begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our cordage torn, decay’d our vessels lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our weeping wives, our tender children call:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Love, duty, safety, summon us away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis nature’s voice, and nature we obey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our shatter’d barks may yet transport us o’er,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His deep design unknown, the hosts approve</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides’ speech. The mighty numbers move.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So roll the billows to the Icarian shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From east and south when winds begin to roar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And as on corn when western gusts descend,<a href="#note_85" id="noteref_85" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">85</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus o’er the field the moving host appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With long-resounding cries they urge the train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To fit the ships, and launch into the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The doubling clamours echo to the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">E’en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove’s imperial queen their flight survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leave unpunish’d this perfidious race?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bravest chiefs, in Helen’s quarrel slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas obeys, and from Olympus’ height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For prudent counsel like the gods renown’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oppress’d with generous grief the hero stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And is it thus, divine Laertes’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fame eternal leave to Priam’s race?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your own resistless eloquence employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The voice divine confess’d the warlike maid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Received the imperial sceptre of command.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch’s will not yet reveal’d appears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He tries our courage, but resents our fears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus the king in secret council spoke.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">While hovering near, with miserable moan,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mother last, as round the nest she flew,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Big with the fate of Ilion, plough’d the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thunder rolling shook the firmament.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Helen’s woes at full revenged appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy’s proud matrons render tear for tear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before that day, if any Greek invite</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His country’s troops to base, inglorious flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In tribes and nations to divide thy train:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And what the cause of Ilion not o’erthrown;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the king: “How much thy years excel</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With the huge shield each brawny arm depress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each spent courser at the chariot blow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dares to tremble on this signal day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On these, in double cauls involved with art,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress’d,</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK III.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The armies being ready to engage, a single 
combat is agreed upon between Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of
 Hector) for the determination of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to
 behold the fight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat 
with his counsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, 
to whom Helen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either
 part take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel 
ensues; wherein Paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by 
Venus, and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the 
walls, and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the 
Grecians, demands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the 
articles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The three-and-twentieth day still continues 
throughout this book. The scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, 
and sometimes in Troy itself.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus by their leaders’ care each martial band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Moves into ranks, and stretches o’er the land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when inclement winters vex the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,<a href="#note_108" id="noteref_108" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">108</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With noise, and order, through the midway sky;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the war descends upon the wing,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill’d<a href="#note_109" id="noteref_109" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">109</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Darkening arises from the labour’d ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A night of vapours round the mountain heads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lost and confused amidst the thicken’d day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So wrapp’d in gathering dust, the Grecian train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now front to front the hostile armies stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eager of fight, and only wait command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, to the van, before the sons of fame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In form a god! the panther’s speckled hide</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flow’d o’er his armour with an easy pride:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bended bow across his shoulders flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sword beside him negligently hung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He boldly stalk’d, the foremost on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So joys a lion, if the branching deer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eager he seizes and devours the slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his high chariot: him, approaching near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees<a href="#note_110" id="noteref_110" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">110</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all confused precipitates his flight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from the king the shining warrior flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Unhappy Paris! but to women brave!<a href="#note_111" id="noteref_111" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">111</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fairly form’d, and only to deceive!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw’st the light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A better fate than vainly thus to boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their fears of danger undeceived in thee!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy figure promised with a martial air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In former days, in all thy gallant pride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When thy tall ships triumphant stemm’d the tide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus from her realm convey’d the beauteous prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen’s eyes?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This deed, thy foes’ delight, thy own disgrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy father’s grief, and ruin of thy race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This deed recalls thee to the proffer’d fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or hast thou injured whom thou dar’st not right?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou keep’st the consort of a braver foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crush the dire author of his country’s woe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy force, like steel, a temper’d hardness shows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With which a lover golden Venus arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet, would’st thou have the proffer’d combat stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then let a midway space our hosts divide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And who his rival can in arms subdue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His be the fair, and his the treasure too.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with his spear restrain’d the youth of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Advanced with steps majestically slow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A parley Hector asks, a message bears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We know him by the various plume he wears.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On either host, and thus to both applies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What Paris, author of the war, demands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here in the midst, in either army’s sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He dares the Spartan king to single fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wills that Helen and the ravish’d spoil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And different nations part in leagues of peace.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke: in still suspense on either side</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A world engages in the toils of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To me the labour of the field resign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fall he that must, beneath his rival’s arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And live the rest, secure of future harms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two lambs, devoted by your country’s rite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To earth a sable, to the sun a white,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Select to Jove, the inviolable king.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let reverend Priam in the truce engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And add the sanction of considerate age;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And youth itself an empty wavering state;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cool age advances, venerably wise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sees what befell, and what may yet befall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Concludes from both, and best provides for all.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nations hear with rising hopes possess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Within the lines they drew their steeds around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from their chariots issued on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On either side the meeting hosts are seen</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With lances fix’d, and close the space between.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two heralds now, despatch’d to Troy, invite</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The various goddess of the rainbow flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Like fair Laodice in form and face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The loveliest nymph of Priam’s royal race:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her in the palace, at her loom she found;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The golden web her own sad story crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the goddess of the painted bow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!<a href="#note_112" id="noteref_112" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">112</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paris alone and Sparta’s king advance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In single fight to toss the beamy lance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, the many-coloured maid inspires</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her husband’s love, and wakes her former fires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her country, parents, all that once were dear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her handmaids, Clymene and Æthra, wait</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Old Priam’s chiefs, and most in Priam’s grace,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lean’d on the walls and bask’d before the sun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But wise through time, and narrative with age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, when the Spartan queen approach’d the tower,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In secret own’d resistless beauty’s power:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They cried, “No wonder such celestial charms<a href="#note_113" id="noteref_113" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">113</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">For nine long years have set the world in arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What winning graces! what majestic mien!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The friends and kindred of thy former years.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around whose brow such martial graces shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So tall, so awful, and almost divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though some of larger stature tread the green,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">None match his grandeur and exalted mien:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He seems a monarch, and his country’s pride.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Before thy presence, father, I appear,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah! had I died, ere to these walls I fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">False to my country, and my nuptial bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">False to them all, to Paris only kind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My brother once, before my days of shame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And oh! that still he bore a brother’s name!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With wonder Priam view’d the godlike man,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Extoll’d the happy prince, and thus began:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O bless’d Atrides! born to prosperous fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Successful monarch of a mighty state!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In ancient time, when Otreus fill’d the throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against the manlike Amazons we stood,<a href="#note_114" id="noteref_114" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">114</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Sangar’s stream ran purple with their blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But far inferior those, in martial grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, once more he view’d the warrior train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What’s he, whose arms lie scatter’d on the plain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though great Atrides overtops his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stately ram thus measures o’er the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, master of the flock, surveys them round.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Helen thus: “Whom your discerning eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A barren island boasts his glorious birth;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antenor took the word, and thus began:<a href="#note_115" id="noteref_115" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">115</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Great Menelaus urged the same request;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My house was honour’d with each royal guest:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I knew their persons, and admired their parts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Atreus’ son harangued the listening train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just was his sense, and his expression plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,<a href="#note_116" id="noteref_116" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">116</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His modest eyes he fix’d upon the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As one unskill’d or dumb, he seem’d to stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor raised his head, nor stretch’d his sceptred hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,<a href="#note_117" id="noteref_117" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">117</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The copious accents fall, with easy art;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wondering we hear, and fix’d in deep surprise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our ears refute the censure of our eyes.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king then ask’d (as yet the camp he view’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What chief is that, with giant strength endued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See! bold Idomeneus superior towers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great as a god! I saw him once before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest I know, and could in order name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One bold on foot, and one renown’d for horse.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My brothers these; the same our native shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One house contain’d us, as one mother bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For distant Troy refused to sail the seas;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ashamed to combat in their sister’s cause.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers’ doom;<a href="#note_118" id="noteref_118" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">118</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Adorn’d with honours in their native shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime the heralds, through the crowded town,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Idaeus’ arms the golden goblets press’d,<a href="#note_119" id="noteref_119" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">119</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who thus the venerable king address’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Arise, O father of the Trojan state!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nations call, thy joyful people wait</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paris, thy son, and Sparta’s king advance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And who his rival shall in arms subdue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His be the dame, and his the treasure too.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shall the Greeks review their native shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To join his milk-white coursers to the car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gentle steeds through Scaea’s gates they guide:<a href="#note_120" id="noteref_120" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">120</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next from the car descending on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arose, and with him rose the king of men.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On either side a sacred herald stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wine they mix, and on each monarch’s hands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the sign’d victims crops the curling hair;<a href="#note_121" id="noteref_121" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">121</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heralds part it, and the princes share;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then loudly thus before the attentive bands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O first and greatest power! whom all obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who high on Ida’s holy mountain sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From east to west, and view from pole to pole!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Infernal furies, and Tartarean gods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Greece returning plough the watery deep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If by my brother’s lance the Trojan bleed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every age record the signal day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that the chief the tender victims slew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vital spirit issued at the wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left the members quivering on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And add libations to the powers divine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus their prayers united mount the sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And may their blood, who first the league confound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all their lust be scatter’d as the dust!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus either host their imprecations join’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rites now finish’d, reverend Priam rose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus express’d a heart o’ercharged with woes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But spare the weakness of my feeble age:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In yonder walls that object let me shun,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor view the danger of so dear a son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, the hoary king no longer stay’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But on his car the slaughter’d victims laid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The people pray with elevated hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And words like these are heard through all the bands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Immortal Jove, high Heaven’s superior lord,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On lofty Ida’s holy mount adored!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whoe’er involved us in this dire debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O give that author of the war to fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shades eternal! let division cease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And joyful nations join in leagues of peace.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, Paris, thine leap’d forth; by fatal chance</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ordain’d the first to whirl the weighty lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Both armies sat the combat to survey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beside each chief his azure armour lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In gilded arms magnificently bright:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With flowers adorn’d, with silver buckles bound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lycaon’s corslet his fair body dress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His youthful face a polish’d helm o’erspread;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal speed and fired by equal charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With javelins fix’d, the Greek and Trojan band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on Atrides’ ringing shield it flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound<a href="#note_122" id="noteref_122" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">122</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap’d from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides then his massy lance prepares,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let this example future times reclaim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And guard from wrong fair friendship’s holy name,”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and poised in air the javelin sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through Paris’ shield the forceful weapon went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glancing downward, near his flank descends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broke short: the fragments glitter’d on the sand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The raging warrior to the spacious skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And is it thus the gods assist the just?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struggling he followed, while the embroider’d thong</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That tied his helmet, dragg’d the chief along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then had his ruin crown’d Atrides’ joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left an empty helmet in his hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks with smiles the polish’d trophy view.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In thirst of vengeance, at his rival’s heart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The queen of love her favour’d champion shrouds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raised from the field the panting youth she led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gently laid him on the bridal bed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime the brightest of the female kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The matchless Helen, o’er the walls reclined;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In borrow’d form, the laughter-loving dame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(She seem’d an ancient maid, well-skill’d to cull</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The goddess softly shook her silken vest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That shed perfumes, and whispering thus address’d:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She spoke, and Helen’s secret soul was moved;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck with her presence, straight the lively red</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forsook her cheek; and trembling, thus she said:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And woman’s frailty always to believe!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, to new nations must I cross the main,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A handmaid goddess at his side to wait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Renounce the glories of thy heavenly state,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus incensed, the Paphian queen replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Obey the power from whom thy glories rise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should Venus leave thee, every charm must fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fade from thy cheek, and languish in thy eye.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cease to provoke me, lest I make thee more</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The world’s aversion, than their love before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now the bright prize for which mankind engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than, the sad victim, of the public rage.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this, the fairest of her sex obey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And veil’d her blushes in a silken shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unseen, and silent, from the train she moves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Led by the goddess of the Smiles and Loves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arrived, and enter’d at the palace gate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The maids officious round their mistress wait;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, all dispersing, various tasks attend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The queen and goddess to the prince ascend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in her Paris’ sight, the queen of love</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had placed the beauteous progeny of Jove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where, as he view’d her charms, she turn’d away</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her glowing eyes, and thus began to say:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Is this the chief, who, lost to sense of shame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Late fled the field, and yet survives his fame?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of that brave man whom once I call’d my lord!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The boaster Paris oft desired the day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Sparta’s king to meet in single fray:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go now, once more thy rival’s rage excite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Provoke Atrides, and renew the fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet Helen bids thee stay, lest thou unskill’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prince replies: “Ah cease, divinely fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor add reproaches to the wounds I bear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day the foe prevail’d by Pallas’ power:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We yet may vanquish in a happier hour:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There want not gods to favour us above;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let the business of our life be love:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These softer moments let delights employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus I loved thee, when from Sparta’s shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My forced, my willing heavenly prize I bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When first entranced in Cranae’s isle I lay,<a href="#note_124" id="noteref_124" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">124</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mix’d with thy soul, and all dissolved away!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having spoke, the enamour’d Phrygian boy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush’d to the bed, impatient for the joy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Helen follow’d slow with bashful charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And clasp’d the blooming hero in her arms.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While these to love’s delicious rapture yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stern Atrides rages round the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So some fell lion whom the woods obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roars through the desert, and demands his prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paris he seeks, impatient to destroy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even those had yielded to a foe so brave</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The recreant warrior, hateful as the grave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then speaking thus, the king of kings arose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye Trojans, Dardans, all our generous foes!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear and attest! from Heaven with conquest crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our brother’s arms the just success have found:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be therefore now the Spartan wealth restor’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Argive Helen own her lawful lord;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And age to age record this signal day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He ceased; his army’s loud applauses rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the long shout runs echoing through the skies.</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK IV.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The gods deliberate in council concerning the 
Trojan war: they agree upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends 
down Minerva to break the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow 
at Menelaus, who is wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some 
of the Trojan troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in 
all the parts of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the 
leaders, some by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly 
celebrated for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great 
numbers are slain on both sides.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The same day continues through this as through 
the last book (as it does also through the two following, and almost to 
the end of the seventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before 
Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now Olympus’ shining gates unfold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia’s spleen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;<a href="#note_125" id="noteref_125" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">125</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tame spectators of his deeds of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus fair Venus helps her favour’d knight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each danger wards, and constant in her care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saves in the moment of the last despair.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her act has rescued Paris’ forfeit life,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though great Atrides gain’d the glorious strife.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet, would the gods for human good provide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still Priam’s walls in peaceful honours grow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through his gates the crowding nations flow.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And queen of war, in close consult engaged:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And meditate the future woes of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though secret anger swell’d Minerva’s breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Juno, impotent of passion, broke</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length ripe vengeance o’er their heads impends,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,<a href="#note_126" id="noteref_126" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">126</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">For know, of all the numerous towns that rise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No mortals merit more distinguish’d grace</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still to our name their hecatombs expire,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of power superior why should I complain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resent I may, but must resent in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet some distinction Juno might require,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">As down thy snowy thigh distill’d the streaming flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With horror seized, the king of men descried</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shaft infix’d, and saw the gushing tide:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less the Spartan fear’d, before he found</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining barb appear above the wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The royal brother thus his grief express’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And grasp’d his hand; while all the Greeks around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With answering sighs return’d the plaintive sound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And faith is scorn’d by all the perjured line.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus our vows, confirm’d with wine and gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall all be vain: when Heaven’s revenge is slow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The day shall come, that great avenging day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Troy’s proud glories in the dust shall lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Priam’s powers and Priam’s self shall fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one prodigious ruin swallow all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I see the god, already, from the pole</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I see the Eternal all his fury shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shake his aegis o’er their guilty head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, alas! deserv’st a happier fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still must I mourn the period of thy days,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And only mourn, without my share of praise?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">‘Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And such the conquest of her king of kings!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo his proud vessels scatter’d o’er the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch’s shame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: a leader’s and a brother’s fears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stiff with the rich embroider’d work around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My varied belt repell’d the flying wound.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the king: “My brother and my friend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His speedy succour to the Spartan king;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecian’s sorrow, and the Dardan’s joy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms incircled with his native bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus: “Machaon, to the king repair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His wounded brother claims thy timely care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A grief to us, a triumph to the foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the chiefs in deep concern around.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where to the steely point the reed was join’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then suck’d the blood, and sovereign balm infused,<a href="#note_133" id="noteref_133" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">133</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which Chiron gave, and Æsculapius used.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more the fields are fill’d with dire alarms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor had you seen the king of men appear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But fond of glory, with severe delight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His beating bosom claim’d the rising fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No longer with his warlike steeds he stay’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or press’d the car with polish’d brass inlaid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fiery coursers snorted at his side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On foot through all the martial ranks he moves</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And these encourages, and those reproves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Brave men!” he cries, (to such who boldly dare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Your ancient valour on the foes approve;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prepared for flight, but doom’d to fly in vain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, he stalk’d with ample strides along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Crete’s brave monarch and his martial throng;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High at their head he saw the chief appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bold Meriones excite the rear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this the king his generous joy express’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And clasp’d the warrior to his armed breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thee the foremost honours are decreed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First in the fight and every graceful deed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restore our blood, and raise the warriors’ souls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmix’d, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the Cretan thus his speech address’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d to thy side, in every toil I share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy firm associate in the day of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let the signal be this moment given;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And chains or death avenge the impious deed.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Charm’d with this heat, the king his course pursues,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And next the troops of either Ajax views:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A cloud of heroes blacken’d all the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus from the lofty promontory’s brow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A swain surveys the gathering storm below;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the close covert of an arching rock.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With spears erect, a moving iron wood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Exclaim’d the king), who raise your eager bands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With great examples, more than loud commands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon should our arms with just success be crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy’s proud walls lie smoking on the ground.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to the next the general bends his course;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(His heart exults, and glories in his force);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with inspiring eloquence commands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With strictest order sets his train in arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The horse and chariots to the front assign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The middle space suspected troops supply,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He gives command to “curb the fiery steed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the rest let none too rashly ride;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He whom the fortune of the field shall cast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content with javelins to provoke the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our great forefathers held this prudent course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By laws like these immortal conquests made,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And earth’s proud tyrants low in ashes laid.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke the master of the martial art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And touch’d with transport great Atrides’ heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But wasting years, that wither human race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And age the lot of any chief but thee.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew<a href="#note_134" id="noteref_134" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">134</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field of combat fits the young and bold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solemn council best becomes the old:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To you the glorious conflict I resign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said. With joy the monarch march’d before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tumult late begun, they stood intent</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To watch the motion, dubious of the event.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Can Peleus’ son forget a warrior’s part.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fears Ulysses, skill’d in every art?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why stand you distant, and the rest expect</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From you ’twas hoped among the first to dare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shock of armies, and commence the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this your names are call’d before the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To share the pleasures of the genial feast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, is it thus those honours you requite?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first in banquets, but the last in fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses heard: the hero’s warmth o’erspread</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior’s due,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dares to act whate’er thou dar’st to view.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O great in action, and in council wise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sage as thou art, and learn’d in human kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forgive the transport of a martial mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and pass’d where great Tydides lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)<a href="#note_135" id="noteref_135" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">135</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hands unactive, and a careless eye?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still first in front the matchless prince appear’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who view’d him labouring through the ranks of fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae’s towers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Armies he ask’d, and armies had been given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While dreadful comets glaring from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forewarn’d the horrors of the Theban war.<a href="#note_136" id="noteref_136" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">136</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A fearless envoy, he approach’d the foes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thebes’ hostile walls unguarded and alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dared to combat all those chiefs around:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung with the shame, within the winding way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two heroes led the secret squadron on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those fifty slaughter’d in the gloomy vale.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No words the godlike Diomed return’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heard respectful, and in secret burn’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so fierce Capaneus’ undaunted son;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our value equal, though our fury less.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fewer troops we storm’d the Theban wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,<a href="#note_137" id="noteref_137" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">137</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In impious acts the guilty father died;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far more than heirs of all our parents’ fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our glories darken their diminish’d name.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him Tydides thus: “My friend, forbear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His high concern may well excuse this rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His the first praise, were Ilion’s towers o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of arm’d Tydides rushing to the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the winds, ascending by degrees,<a href="#note_138" id="noteref_138" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">138</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First move the whitening surface of the seas,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The billows float in order to the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wave behind rolls on the wave before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Foam o’er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So to the fight the thick battalions throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No sound, no whisper, but the chief’s commands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those only heard; with awe the rest obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As if some god had snatch’d their voice away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A general shout that all the region rends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the fleecy flocks unnumber’d stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In wealthy folds, and wait the milker’s hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hollow vales incessant bleating fills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such clamours rose from various nations round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mix’d was the murmur, and confused the sound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each host now joins, and each a god inspires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And discord raging bathes the purple plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Small at her birth, but rising every hour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;<a href="#note_139" id="noteref_139" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">139</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nations bleed, where’er her steps she turns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Victors and vanquish’d join’d promiscuous cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush to the vales, and pour’d along the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roar through a thousand channels to the main:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At great Echepolus the lance arrives,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warm’d in the brain the brazen weapon lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shades eternal settle o’er his eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of force and fire, its walls besmear’d with blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,<a href="#note_140" id="noteref_140" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">140</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seized to despoil, and dragg’d the corpse along:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Agenor’s javelin reach’d the hero’s heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The war renews, the warriors bleed again:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As o’er their prey rapacious wolves engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the flocks on silver Simois’ shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To seek her parents on his flowery side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So falls a poplar, that in watery ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raised high the head, with stately branches crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fell’d by some artist with his shining steel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With all its beauteous honours on its head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, left a subject to the wind and rain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scorch’d by suns, it withers on the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d on the shore, and thus neglected dies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pointed lance with erring fury flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d with his spear, he meditates the wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In act to throw; but cautious look’d around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Priam’s son, Democoon was his name.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weapon entered close above his ear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;<a href="#note_141" id="noteref_141" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">141</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his broad buckler rings against the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">E’en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Phoebus now from Ilion’s towering height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shines forth reveal’d, and animates the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb’d with steel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have ye forgot what seem’d your dread before?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo thus from Ilion’s lofty towers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Array’d in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While war’s fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shouts and thunders in the fields below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain his valour and illustrious line.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Who from cold Ænus led the Thracian crew,)<a href="#note_142" id="noteref_142" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">142</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his ankle dropp’d the ponderous stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Burst the strong nerves, and crash’d the solid bone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his helpless friends, and native bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foe rush’d furious as he pants for breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through his navel drove the pointed death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the warm life came issuing from the wound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in his breast above the pap it went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the lungs was fix’d the winged wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till from the dying chief, approaching near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Ætolian warrior tugg’d his weighty spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gash’d his belly with a ghastly wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Thracian bands against the victor press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A grove of lances glitter’d at his breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one the leader of the Epeian race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Death’s sable shade at once o’ercast their eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dust the vanquish’d and the victor lies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With copious slaughter all the fields are red,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heap’d with growing mountains of the dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Might darts be bid to turn their points away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And swords around him innocently play;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The war’s whole art with wonder had he seen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And counted heroes where he counted men.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK V.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE ACTS OF DIOMED.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in
 this day’s battle. Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess 
cures him, enables him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him 
from contending with any of the former, excepting Venus. Æneas joins 
Pandarus to oppose him; Pandarus is killed, and Æneas in great danger 
but for the assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from 
the fight, is wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his 
rescue, and at length carries off Æneas to Troy, where he is healed in 
the temple of Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to 
make a stand. In the meantime Æneas is restored to the field, and they 
overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by 
Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites 
Diomed to go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to 
heaven.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in the former.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Pallas now Tydides’ soul inspires,<a href="#note_143" id="noteref_143" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">143</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And crown her hero with distinguish’d praise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on his helm celestial lightnings play,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His beamy shield emits a living ray;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Onward she drives him, furious to engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Dares first the combat sought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Vulcan’s fane the father’s days were led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These singled from their troops the fight maintain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spent in empty air its erring force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But pierced his breast, and stretch’d him on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He too had sunk to death’s eternal shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But in a smoky cloud the god of fire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When by the blood-stain’d hand Minerva press’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of battles, and this speech address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While we from interdicted fields retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor tempt the wrath of heaven’s avenging sire.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her words allay the impetuous warrior’s heat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of arms and martial maid retreat;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Removed from fight, on Xanthus’ flowery bounds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They sat, and listen’d to the dying sounds.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And some bold chieftain every leader slew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His death ennobled by Atrides’ hand:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As he to flight his wheeling car address’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom’d to feel</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Idomeneus’ protended steel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Cretan javelin reach’d him from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And everlasting shades his eyes surround.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But vainly here Diana’s arts he tries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Menelaus’ arm the weapon sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His brazen armour rings against the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy father’s skill, O Phereclus! was thine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The graceful fabric and the fair design;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the shipwright’s and the builder’s art.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fatal cause of all his country’s woes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor saw his country’s peril, nor his own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hapless artist, while confused he fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between the bladder and the bone it pass’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Meges’ force the swift Pedaeus fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antenor’s offspring from a foreign bed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nursed the young stranger with a mother’s care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in his nape infix’d the fatal spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from the brave Dolopion’s mighty line,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who near adored Scamander made abode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On him, amidst the flying numbers found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence glancing downwards, lopp’d his holy hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which stain’d with sacred blood the blushing sand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress’d his breath.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus toil’d the chiefs, in different parts engaged.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rapt through the ranks he thunders o’er the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through ruin’d moles the rushing wave resounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erwhelm’s the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The yellow harvests of the ripen’d year,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!<a href="#note_144" id="noteref_144" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">144</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the labours of mankind are vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With grief the leader of the Lycian band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bended bow against the chief he drew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the proud archer thus exulting cried:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stopp’d short of life, and mock’d the shooter’s art.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wounded chief, behind his car retired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The helping hand of Sthenelus required;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift from his seat he leap’d upon the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tugg’d the weapon from the gushing wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When thus the king his guardian power address’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The purple current wandering o’er his vest:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O progeny of Jove! unconquer’d maid!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er I felt thee in the fighting field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard’st in fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus pray’d Tydides, and Minerva heard,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His nerves confirm’d, his languid spirits cheer’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His beating bosom claim’d the promised fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War be thy province, thy protection mine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush to the fight, and every foe control;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,<a href="#note_145" id="noteref_145" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">145</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And set to view the warring deities.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If Venus mingle in the martial band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing’d her flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero rush’d impetuous to the fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If chance some shepherd with a distant dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then leaps victorious o’er the lofty mound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And two brave leaders at an instant slew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His people’s pastor, good Hypenor, died;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Astynous’ breast the deadly lance receives,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hypenor’s shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Abas and Polyidus to engage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youths return’d not from the doubtful plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the sad father tried his arts in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No mystic dream could make their fates appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though now determined by Tydides’ spear.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The joy and hope of Phaenops’ feeble age:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all his labours and a life of cares.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cold death o’ertakes them in their blooming years,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leaves the father unavailing tears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To strangers now descends his heapy store,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The race forgotten, and the name no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the lordly lion seeks his food</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With deep concern divine Æneas view’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length he found Lycaon’s mighty son;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the chief of Venus’ race begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall’d fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And boasted glory of the Lycian name?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whoe’er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the Lycian: “Whom your eyes behold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such coursers whirl him o’er the dusty field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If ’tis a god, he wears that chief’s disguise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I wing’d an arrow, which not idly fell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stroke had fix’d him to the gates of hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, but some god, some angry god withstands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fate was due to these unerring hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d in the bow, on foot I sought the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor join’d swift horses to the rapid car.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ten polish’d chariots I possess’d at home,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And still they grace Lycaon’s princely dome:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There veil’d in spacious coverlets they stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twice ten coursers wait their lord’s command.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The good old warrior bade me trust to these,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When first for Troy I sail’d the sacred seas;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Might fail of forage in the straiten’d town;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So took my bow and pointed darts in hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left the chariots in my native land.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydeus’ and Atreus’ sons their points have found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And undissembled gore pursued the wound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In evil hour these bended horns I strung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seized the quiver where it idly hung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without a warrior’s arms, the spear and shield!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er with life I quit the Trojan plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er I see my spouse and sire again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the leader of the Dardan race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Be calm, nor Phoebus’ honour’d gift disgrace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The distant dart be praised, though here we need</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against yon hero let us bend our course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now mount my seat, and from the chariot’s height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observe my father’s steeds, renown’d in fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior’s fury let this arm sustain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Take thou the spear, the chariot’s care be mine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O prince! (Lycaon’s valiant son replied)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The horses, practised to their lord’s command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy voice alone can animate their flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else shall our fates be number’d with the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And these, the victor’s prize, in triumph led.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself will charge this terror of the field.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now both heroes mount the glittering car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who thus, alarm’d, to great Tydides cried:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon’s line,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Æneas, sprung from race divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And save a life, the bulwark of our war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this the hero cast a gloomy look,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Know, ’tis not honest in my soul to fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I hate the cumbrous chariot’s slow advance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the long distance of the flying lance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That both shall fall by one victorious hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then heed my words: my horses here detain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d to the chariot by the straiten’d rein;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to Æneas’ empty seat proceed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The race of those, which once the thundering god<a href="#note_146" id="noteref_146" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">146</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ravish’d Ganymede on Tros bestow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best that e’er on earth’s broad surface run,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the rising or the setting sun.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Four of this race his ample stalls contain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And two transport Æneas o’er the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, were the rich immortal prize our own,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the wide world should make our glory known.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stern Lycaon’s warlike race begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear may enter where the arrow fail’d.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye ’scape not both; one, headlong from his car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hostile blood shall glut the god of war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and rising hurl’d his forceful dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in his face it enter’d, and betwixt</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crash’d all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till the bright point look’d out beneath the chin.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The starting coursers tremble with affright;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard his slaughter’d friend, Æneas flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His spear extending where the carcase lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the grim lion stalks around his prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the fall’n trunk his ample shield display’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He hides the hero with his mighty shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such men as live in these degenerate days:<a href="#note_147" id="noteref_147" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">147</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stripp’d the skin, and crack’d the solid bone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden cloud comes swimming o’er his eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oppress’d had sunk to death’s eternal shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His danger views with anguish and despair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And guards her offspring with a mother’s care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">About her much-loved son her arms she throws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Screen’d from the foe behind her shining veil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe through the rushing horse, and feather’d flight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Remain’d unheedful of his lord’s commands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His panting steeds, removed from out the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fix’d with straiten’d traces to the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These in proud triumph to the fleet convey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No longer now a Trojan lord obey’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That charge to bold Deipylus he gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And follow’d where Tydides swept the plain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No goddess she, commission’d to the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">New to the field, and still a foe to fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And at the goddess his broad lance extends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the transparent skin with crimson stain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the clear vein a stream immortal flow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such stream as issues from a wounded god;<a href="#note_148" id="noteref_148" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">148</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For not the bread of man their life sustains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor wine’s inflaming juice supplies their veins:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tender shrieks the goddess fill’d the place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dropp’d her offspring from her weak embrace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Phoebus took: he casts a cloud around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king insults the goddess as she flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ill with Jove’s daughter bloody fights agree,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field of combat is no scene for thee:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Taught by this stroke renounce the war’s alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And learn to tremble at the name of arms.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides thus. The goddess, seized with dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The queen of love with faded charms she found.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pale was her cheek, and livid look’d the wound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beside him stood his lance, distain’d with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, rein’d with gold, his foaming steeds before.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Low at his knee, she begg’d with streaming eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her brother’s car, to mount the distant skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And show’d the wound by fierce Tydides given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to her hand commits the golden rein;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She mounts the seat, oppress’d with silent woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Driven by the goddess of the painted bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in a moment scales the lofty skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They stopp’d the car, and there the coursers stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before her mother, love’s bright queen appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ask’d what god had wrought this guilty deed?</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flush’d with celestial blood pursued his way,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already in his hopes he saw him kill’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though screen’d behind Apollo’s mighty shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How vast the difference of the gods and thee;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rise in thy wrath! to hell’s abhorr’d abodes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretch would brave high heaven’s immortal sire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of battle issues on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo, brave Æneas sinks beneath his wound,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste all, and take the generous warrior’s part.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said;—new courage swell’d each hero’s heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sarpedon first his ardent soul express’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, turn’d to Hector, these bold words address’d:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That propp’d alone by Priam’s race should stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy’s sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Remote they stand while alien troops engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like trembling hounds before the lion’s rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far distant hence I held my wide command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With those I left whatever dear could be:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten’d state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or one vast burst of all-involving fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full o’er your towers shall fall, and sweep away</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish’d prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But just reproof with decent silence bears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two shining spears are brandish’d in his hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus arm’d, he animates his drooping bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when, on Ceres’ sacred floor, the swain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The grey dust, rising with collected winds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drives o’er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So white with dust the Grecian host appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dusky clouds from labour’d earth arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mars hovers o’er them with his sable shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And adds new horrors to the darken’d field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Troy’s defence, Apollo’s heavenly will:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Produced Æneas to the shouting train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alive, unharm’d, with all his peers around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No pause of words admits, no dull delay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field’s in flames.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Serenely dreadful, and as fix’d as fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when the embattled clouds in dark array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the skies their gloomy lines display;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor was the general wanting to his train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your brave associates and yourselves revere!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On valour’s side the odds of combat lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brave live glorious, or lamented die;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These words he seconds with his flying lance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To meet whose point was strong Deicoon’s chance:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas’ friend, and in his native place</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Honour’d and loved like Priam’s royal race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long had he fought the foremost in the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now the monarch’s lance transpierced his shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The grisly wound dismiss’d his soul to hell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arms around him rattled as he fell.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fierce Æneas, brandishing his blade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:<a href="#note_152" id="noteref_152" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">152</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from Alpheus’ plenteous stream, that yields</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And these descended in the third degree.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Too early expert in the martial toil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In sable ships they left their native soil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till pierced at distance from their native den,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god but urged him to provoke his fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He thus advancing, Nestor’s valiant son</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck with the thought, should Helen’s lord be slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all his country’s glorious labours vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already met, the threatening heroes stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spears already tremble in their hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In rush’d Antilochus, his aid to bring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These seen, the Dardan backward turn’d his course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brave as he was, and shunn’d unequal force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides mark’d him where sublime he stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in his throat the javelin drank his blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The faithful Mydon, as he turn’d from fight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A broken rock by Nestor’s son was thrown:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bended arm received the falling stone;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his numb’d hand the ivory-studded reins,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dropp’d in the dust, are trail’d along the plains:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The head stood fix’d, the quivering legs in air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till trampled flat beneath the coursers’ feet:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fires his host with animating cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And brings along the furies of the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Hector march’d, the god of battles shined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now storm’d before him, and now raged behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides paused amidst his full career;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then first the hero’s manly breast knew fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wide through fens an unknown journey takes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If chance a swelling brook his passage stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And foam impervious ’cross the wanderer’s way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused he stops, a length of country pass’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stay’d, and turning thus address’d his bands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His strokes they second, and avert our spears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retire, but with your faces to the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trust not too much your unavailing might;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not with Troy, but with the gods ye fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In every art of glorious war renown’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the same car the chiefs to combat ride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fought united, and united died.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His massy spear with matchless fury sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through Amphius’ belt and heaving belly went;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amphius Apaesus’ happy soil possess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With herds abounding, and with treasure bless’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But fate resistless from his country led</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief, to perish at his people’s head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around his head an iron tempest rain’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wood of spears his ample shield sustain’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He could no more; the showering darts denied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With bristling lances, and compacted shields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till in the steely circle straiten’d round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,<a href="#note_153" id="noteref_153" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">153</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urged by the force of unresisted fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Burns with desire Sarpedon’s strength to prove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alcides’ offspring meets the son of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove’s great descendant, and his greater son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What brings this Lycian counsellor so far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who style thee son of cloud-compelling Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How far unlike those chiefs of race divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How vast the difference of their deeds and thine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With six small ships, and but a slender train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He left the town a wide-deserted plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But what art thou, who deedless look’st around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I make this present to the shades below.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Hercules, the Rhodian guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus haughty spoke. The Lycian king replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy sire, O prince! o’erturn’d the Trojan state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">False he detain’d, the just reward of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor so content, the generous chief defied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With base reproaches and unmanly pride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But you, unworthy the high race you boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Add one more ghost to Pluto’s gloomy reign.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: both javelins at an instant flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon’s slew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in the boaster’s neck the weapon stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Transfix’d his throat, and drank the vital blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his seal’d eyes for ever lose the light.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sarpedon’s thigh, had robb’d the chief of breath;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove was present, and forbade the death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wounded hero dragg’d the lance along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(His friends, each busied in his several part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose fall Ulysses view’d, with fury fired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Doubtful if Jove’s great son he should pursue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heaven and fate the first design withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor this great death must grace Ulysses’ hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alastor, Cronius, Halius, strew’d the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alcander, Prytanis, Noemon fell:<a href="#note_154" id="noteref_154" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">154</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And numbers more his sword had sent to hell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector saw; and, furious at the sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush’d terrible amidst the ranks of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joy Sarpedon view’d the wish’d relief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O suffer not the foe to bear away</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If I, unbless’d, must see my son no more,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My much-loved consort, and my native shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet let me die in Ilion’s sacred wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy, in whose cause I fell, shall mourn my fall.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, nor Hector to the chief replies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The carnage Juno from the skies survey’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief thus answered mild: “Immortal maid!</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The gods having left the field, the Grecians 
prevail. Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to 
the city, in order to appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the 
Trojan matrons to the temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed
 from the fight. The battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, 
Glaucus and Diomed have an interview between the two armies; where, 
coming to the knowledge, of the friendship and hospitality passed 
between their ancestors, they make exchange of their arms. Hector, 
having performed the orders of Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to
 the battle, and, taking a tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens 
again to the field.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To human force and human skill the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Troy’s famed streams, that bound the deathful plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On either side, run purple to the main.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broke the thick ranks, and turn’d the doubtful day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Thracian Acamas his falchion found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hew’d the enormous giant to the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the black horse-hair nodded o’er his crest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in his front the brazen weapon lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next Teuthras’ son distain’d the sands with blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In fair Arisbe’s walls (his native place)<a href="#note_161" id="noteref_161" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">161</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He held his seat! a friend to human race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast by the road, his ever-open door</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breathless the good man fell, and by his side</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His faithful servant, old Calesius died.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By great Euryalus was Dresus slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And next he laid Opheltius on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Laomedon’s white flocks Bucolion fed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That monarch’s first-born by a foreign bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In secret woods he won the naiad’s grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And two fair infants crown’d his strong embrace:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruthless victor stripp’d their shining arms.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Astyalus by Polypoetes fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses’ spear Pidytes sent to hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Teucer’s shaft brave Aretaon bled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Nestor’s son laid stern Ablerus dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who held in Pedasus his proud abode,<a href="#note_162" id="noteref_162" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">162</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And till’d the banks where silver Satnio flow’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unbless’d Adrastus next at mercy lies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scared with the din and tumult of the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush’d on a tamarisk’s strong trunk, and broke</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shatter’d chariot from the crooked yoke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide o’er the field, resistless as the wind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides o’er him shakes his vengeful steel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fallen chief in suppliant posture press’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor’s knees, and thus his prayer address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O spare my youth, and for the life I owe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large gifts of price my father shall bestow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy hollow ships his captive son detain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,<a href="#note_163" id="noteref_163" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">163</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And steel well-temper’d, and persuasive gold.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: compassion touch’d the hero’s heart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stood, suspended with the lifted dart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As pity pleaded for his vanquish’d prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, furious, thus: “Oh impotent of mind!<a href="#note_164" id="noteref_164" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">164</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall these, shall these Atrides’ mercy find?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Well hast thou known proud Troy’s perfidious land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And well her natives merit at thy hand!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ilion shall perish whole, and bury all;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;<a href="#note_165" id="noteref_165" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">165</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A dreadful lesson of exampled fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To warn the nations, and to curb the great!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To rigid justice steel’d his brother’s breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch’s javelin stretch’d him in the dust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then pressing with his foot his panting heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth from the slain he tugg’d the reeking dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Nestor saw, and roused the warrior’s rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No son of Mars descend, for servile gains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To touch the booty, while a foe remains.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First gain the conquest, then reward the toil.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now had Greece eternal fame acquired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And frighted Troy within her walls, retired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had not sage Helenus her state redress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Hector stood, with great Æneas join’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The seer reveal’d the counsels of his mind:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The cares and glories of this doubtful day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On whom your aids, your country’s hopes depend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wise to consult, and active to defend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere yet their wives’ soft arms the cowards gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sport and insult of the hostile train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When your commands have hearten’d every band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourselves, here fix’d, will make the dangerous stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d as we are, and sore of former fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These straits demand our last remains of might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And teach our mother what the gods require:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Direct the queen to lead the assembled train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Troy’s chief matrons to Minerva’s fane;<a href="#note_166" id="noteref_166" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">166</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With offer’d vows, in Ilion’s topmost tower.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Most prized for art, and labour’d o’er with gold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the goddess’ honour’d knees be spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twelve young heifers to her altars led:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our wives, our infants, and our city spare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And far avert Tydides’ wasteful ire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In rage unbounded, and unmatch’d in might.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap’d from his trembling chariot to the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all his host inspiring force he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bids the thunder of the battle rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All Greece recedes, and ’midst her triumphs fears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot down avenging from the vault of stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus aloud: “Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And you whom distant nations send to war!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One hour demands me in the Trojan wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bid our altars flame, and victims fall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shall, I trust, the matrons’ holy train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, with ample strides the hero pass’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shield’s large orb behind his shoulder cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His neck o’ershading, to his ankle hung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And as he march’d the brazen buckler rung.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),<a href="#note_167" id="noteref_167" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">167</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus’ son</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between both armies met: the chiefs from far</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observed each other, and had mark’d for war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near as they drew, Tydides thus began:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What art thou, boldest of the race of man?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our eyes till now that aspect ne’er beheld,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where fame is reap’d amid the embattled field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet far before the troops thou dar’st appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Know with immortals we no more contend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not long Lycurgus view’d the golden light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That daring man who mix’d with gods in fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bacchus, and Bacchus’ votaries, he drove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With brandish’d steel, from Nyssa’s sacred grove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their consecrated spears lay scatter’d round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With curling vines and twisted ivy bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Thetis’ arms received the trembling god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fail’d the crime the immortals’ wrath to move;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The immortals bless’d with endless ease above;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deprived of sight by their avenging doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cheerless he breathed, and wander’d in the gloom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach, and enter the dark gates of death.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Another race the following spring supplies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They fall successive, and successive rise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So generations in their course decay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So flourish these, when those are pass’d away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if thou still persist to search my birth,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The various textures and the various dyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She chose a veil that shone superior far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glow’d refulgent as the morning star.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Herself with this the long procession leads;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The train majestically slow proceeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as to Ilion’s topmost tower they come,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And awful reach the high Palladian dome,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antenor’s consort, fair Theano, waits</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As Pallas’ priestess, and unbars the gates.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hands uplifted and imploring eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They fill the dome with supplicating cries.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The priestess then the shining veil displays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Placed on Minerva’s knees, and thus she prays:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy’s strong defence, unconquer’d Pallas, aid!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Break thou Tydides’ spear, and let him fall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So pray’d the priestess in her holy fane;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So vow’d the matrons, but they vow’d in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While these appear before the power with prayers,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pompous structure, and the town commands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of full ten cubits was the lance’s length,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steely point with golden ringlets join’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before him brandish’d, at each motion shined</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country’s foe!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paris and Greece against us both conspire,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Brother, ’tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scamandrius, from Scamander’s honour’d stream;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Astyanax the Trojans call’d the boy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his great father, the defence of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To tender passions all his mighty mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His beauteous princess cast a mournful look,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And think’st thou not how wretched we shall be,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A widow I, a helpless orphan he?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For sure such courage length of life denies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou must fall, thy virtue’s sacrifice.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shall my days in one sad tenor run,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And end with sorrows as they first begun.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No parent now remains my griefs to share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No father’s aid, no mother’s tender care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fate compassion in the victor bred;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And laid him decent on the funeral pile;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove’s sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A barren shade, and in his honour grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one sad day beheld the gates of hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My mother lived to wear the victor’s bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The queen of Hippoplacia’s sylvan lands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Redeem’d too late, she scarce beheld again</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her pleasing empire and her native plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When ah! oppress’d by life-consuming woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She fell a victim to Diana’s bow.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Yet while my Hector still survives, I see</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more will perish, if my Hector fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh, prove a husband’s and a father’s care!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou, from this tower defend the important post;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let others in the field their arms employ,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief replied: “That post shall be my care,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy’s proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attaint the lustre of my former name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My early youth was bred to martial pains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My soul impels me to the embattled plains!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let me be foremost to defend the throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And guard my father’s glories, and my own.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My mother’s death, the ruin of my kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not Priam’s hoary hairs defiled with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Argive looms our battles to design,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And woes, of which so large a part was thine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bear the victor’s hard commands, or bring</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weight of waters from Hyperia’s spring.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There while you groan beneath the load of life,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They cry, ‘Behold the mighty Hector’s wife!’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May I lie cold before that dreadful day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d with a load of monumental clay!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The babe clung crying to his nurse’s breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector hasted to relieve his child,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then kiss’d the child, and, lifting high in air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to the gods preferr’d a father’s prayer:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against his country’s foes the war to wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rise the Hector of the future age!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when triumphant from successful toils</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And say, ‘This chief transcends his father’s fame:’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mother’s conscious heart o’erflows with joy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hush’d to repose, and with a smile survey’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She mingled with a smile a tender tear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soften’d chief with kind compassion view’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Andromache! my soul’s far better part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No hostile hand can antedate my doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d is the term to all the race of earth;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And such the hard condition of our birth:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No force can then resist, no flight can save,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more—but hasten to thy tasks at home,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me glory summons to the martial scene,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field of combat is the sphere for men.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first in danger as the first in fame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That stream’d at every look; then, moving slow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all her train the soft infection ran;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now, no longer deaf to honour’s call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wanton courser thus with reins unbound<a href="#note_176" id="noteref_176" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">176</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pamper’d and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And laves, in height of blood his shining sides;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His head now freed, he tosses to the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He snuffs the females in the distant plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And springs, exulting, to his fields again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms refulgent as the god of day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Priam, glorying in his might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush’d forth with Hector to the fields of fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now, the warriors passing on the way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The graceful Paris first excused his stay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the noble Hector thus replied:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy power in war with justice none contest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or godlike Paris live a woman’s slave!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste then, in all their glorious labours share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These ills shall cease, whene’er by Jove’s decree</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Greece indignant through her seas returns.”</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK VII.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The battle renewing with double ardour upon the
 return of Hector, Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. 
Apollo, seeing her descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate.
 They agree to put off the general engagement for that day, and incite 
Hector to challenge the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes 
accepting the challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These 
heroes, after several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans 
calling a council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks,
 to which Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches.
 Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for 
burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When
 the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of 
Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked 
with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies 
his jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. 
Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the 
Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The three and twentieth day ends with the duel 
of Hector and Ajax, the next day the truce is agreed; another is taken 
up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the 
fortification before the ships. So that somewhat about three days is 
employed in this book. The scene lies wholly in the field.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rush’d impetuous through the Scaean gate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Paris follow’d to the dire alarms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when to sailors labouring through the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So welcome these to Troy’s desiring train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bands are cheer’d, the war awakes again.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Paris first the work of death begun</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On great Menestheus, Areithous’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from the fair Philomeda’s embrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pleasing Arne was his native place.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow<a href="#note_177" id="noteref_177" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">177</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his neck, from Hector’s weighty hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And roll’d, with limbs relax’d, along the land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Glaucus’ spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drop the cold useless members on the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shot less swift from Ilion’s towery height.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To give to Greece the long divided day?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day, the business of the field suspend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since vengeful goddesses confederate join</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To raze her walls, though built by hands divine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the progeny of Jove replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“I left, for this, the council of the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What art shall calm the furious sons of war?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To her the god: “Great Hector’s soul incite</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A warrior worthy to be Hector’s foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go forth persuasive, and a while engage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warring nations to suspend their rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then dare the boldest of the hostile train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To mortal combat on the listed plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For not this day shall end thy glorious date;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with his spear restrain’d the youth of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Held by the midst athwart. On either hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,<a href="#note_178" id="noteref_178" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">178</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With silent joy the settling hosts survey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In form of vultures, on the beech’s height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They sit conceal’d, and wait the future fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a general darkness veils the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat’ry plain,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And a still horror saddens all the deeps;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus in thick orders settling wide around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector first amidst both armies broke</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War with a fiercer tide once more returns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From all your troops select the boldest knight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let my body, to my friends return’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If mine the glory to despoil the foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Phoebus’ temple I’ll his arms bestow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The breathless carcase to your navy sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which when some future mariner surveys,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wash’d by broad Hellespont’s resounding seas,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus shall he say, ‘A valiant Greek lies there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stone shall tell your vanquish’d hero’s name</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And distant ages learn the victor’s fame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This fierce defiance Greece astonish’d heard,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Blush’d to refuse, and to accept it fear’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How great the shame, when every age shall know</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That not a Grecian met this noble foe!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself will dare the danger of the day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis man’s bold task the generous strife to try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But in the hands of God is victory.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His manly limbs in azure arms he dress’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That day, Atrides! a superior hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had stretch’d thee breathless on the hostile strand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But all at once, thy fury to compose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy daring hand, and this advice address’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector’s arm is mightier far than thine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even fierce Achilles learn’d its force to fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling met this dreadful son of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though bold and burning with desire of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content the doubtful honour might forego,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So great the danger, and so brave the foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and turn’d his brother’s vengeful mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stoop’d to reason, and his rage resign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No longer bent to rush on certain harms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to the kings he spoke: “What grief, what shame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once with what joy the generous prince would hear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of every chief who fought this glorious war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Participate their fame, and pleased inquire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each name, each action, and each hero’s sire!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling all before one hostile hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How would he lift his aged arms on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Years might again roll back, my youth renew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And give this arm the spring which once it knew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When fierce in war, where Jardan’s waters fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I led my troops to Phea’s trembling wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.<a href="#note_179" id="noteref_179" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">179</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud Areithous’ dreadful arms to wield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Areithous, known from shore to shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor aught the warrior’s thundering mace avail’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had given the vanquish’d, now the victor bore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when old age had dimm’d Lycurgus’ eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Ereuthalion he consign’d the prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious with this he crush’d our levell’d bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dared the trial of the strongest hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All saw, and fear’d, his huge tempestuous sway</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till I, the youngest of the host, appear’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, youngest, met whom all our army fear’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone fell the giant o’er a length of ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What then I was, O were your Nestor now!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not Hector’s self should want an equal foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Up-started fierce: but far before the rest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oileus follow’d; Idomen was there,<a href="#note_180" id="noteref_180" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">180</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All these, alike inspired with noble rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What chief shall combat, let the gods decide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His country’s fame, his own immortal praise.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lots produced, each hero signs his own:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then in the general’s helm the fates are thrown,<a href="#note_181" id="noteref_181" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">181</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vows like these ascend from all the bands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A worthy champion for the Grecian state:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap’d forth the lot, of every Greek desired.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This from the right to left the herald bears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Held out in order to the Grecian peers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then casts before him, and with transport cries:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Saturn’s son be all your vows address’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Said I in secret? No, your vows declare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In such a voice as fills the earth and air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, born to combats, fear no force on earth.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said. The troops with elevated eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O father of mankind, superior lord!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who in the highest heaven hast fix’d thy throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That both may claim it, and that both may share.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He moves to combat with majestic pace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,<a href="#note_182" id="noteref_182" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">182</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus march’d the chief, tremendous as a god;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:<a href="#note_183" id="noteref_183" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">183</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His massy javelin quivering in his hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through every Argive heart new transport ran;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from a brazen tower, o’erlook’d the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o’ercast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in all arts of armoury excell’d,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Ajax bore before his manly breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hector! approach my arm, and singly know</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not void of soul, and not unskill’d in war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sends thee one, a sample of her host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more—be sudden, and begin the fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O son of Telamon, thy country’s pride!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">New to the field, and trembling at the fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou meet’st a chief deserving of thy arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I know to shift my ground, remount the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bear thick battle on my sounding shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But open be our fight, and bold each blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I steal no conquest from a noble foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and rising, high above the field</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whirl’d the long lance against the sevenfold shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the brass descending from above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till in the seventh it fix’d. Then Ajax threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through Hector’s shield the forceful javelin flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His corslet enters, and his garment rends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The blunted point against the buckler bends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It reach’d his neck, with matchless strength impell’d!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hollow brass resounded with the shock:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His slacken’d knees received the numbing stroke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector falls extended on the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bulk supporting on the shatter’d shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo’s might</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confirm’d his sinews, and restored to fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now both heroes their broad falchions drew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In flaming circles round their heads they flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But then by heralds’ voice the word was given.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first Idaeus’ awful voice was heard:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Both dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To either host your matchless worth is known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now the Night extends her awful shade;</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom great Ajax his high soul express’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O sage! to Hector be these words address’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let him demand the sanction of the night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If first he ask’d it, I content obey,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With strength of body, and with worth of mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now martial law commands us to forbear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let the gods decide of death or life!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector’s life.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let us, on this memorable day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">‘Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.’”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, a sword with stars of silver graced,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A radiant belt that rich with purple glow’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hail with joy the Champion of their state;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Escaped great Ajax, they survey him round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alive, unarm’d, and vigorous from his wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Troy’s high gates the godlike man they bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their present triumph, as their late despair.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-arm’d Greeks to Agamemnon lead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A steer for sacrifice the king design’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king himself (an honorary sign)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now the rage of hunger was removed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sage whose counsels long had sway’d the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In words like these his prudent thought express’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What Greeks are perish’d! what a people lost!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What tides of blood have drench’d Scamander’s shore!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow’s light</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some space at least permit the war to breathe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While we to flames our slaughter’d friends bequeath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the red field their scatter’d bodies bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pious children o’er their ashes weep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er them all a general tomb be raised;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From space to space be ample gates around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For passing chariots; and a trench profound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Greece to combat shall in safety go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile, convened at Priam’s palace-gate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A senate void of order, as of choice:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And I but move what every god requires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Sparta’s treasures be this hour restored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our impious battles the just gods provoke.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As this advice ye practise, or reject,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So hope success, or dread the dire effect.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But sound ungrateful in a warrior’s ears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old man, if void of fallacy or art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But wisdom has its date, assign’d by heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their treasures I’ll restore, but not the dame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But be this bright possession ever mine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas then, the growing discord to compose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His godlike aspect deep attention drew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He paused, and these pacific words ensue:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now take refreshment as the hour demands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before their ships proclaim my son’s intent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next let a truce be ask’d, that Troy may burn</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch’d with haste</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The words of Troy, and Troy’s great monarch, hear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What Paris, author of the war, declares.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Oh had he perish’d ere they touch’d our shore!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He proffers injured Greece: with large increase</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But to restore the beauteous bride again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their proffer’d wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy already totters to her fall.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With general shouts return’d him loud acclaim.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Herald! in him thou hear’st the voice of Greece</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For what remains; let funeral flames be fed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With heroes’ corps: I war not with the dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gratify the manes of the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and rear’d his sceptre to the sky.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To wait the event, the herald bent his way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He came, and standing in the midst, explain’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The peace rejected, but the truce obtain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hew’d the green forests, and the bodies bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now from forth the chambers of the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To shed his sacred light on earth again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arose the golden chariot of the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tipp’d the mountains with a purple ray.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through heaps of carnage search’d the mournful plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce could the friend his slaughter’d friend explore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With dust dishonour’d, and deformed with gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wounds they wash’d, their pious tears they shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sage Priam check’d their grief: with silent haste</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bodies decent on the piles were placed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With melting hearts the cold remains they burn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And decent on the pile dispose the dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The cold remains consume with equal care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, ere the morn had streak’d with reddening light</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The doubtful confines of the day and night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">About the dying flames the Greeks appear’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round the pile a general tomb they rear’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:<a href="#note_186" id="noteref_186" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">186</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From space to space were ample gates around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For passing chariots, and a trench profound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of large extent; and deep in earth below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strong piles infix’d stood adverse to the foe.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So toil’d the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In shining circle round their father Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If the proud Grecians thus successful boast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See the long walls extending to the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No god consulted, and no victim slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their fame shall fill the world’s remotest ends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While old Laomedon’s divine abodes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solid earth’s eternal basis shake!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What cause of fear from mortal works could move<a href="#note_187" id="noteref_187" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">187</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The meanest subject of our realms above?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where’er the sun’s refulgent rays are cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy power is honour’d, and thy fame shall last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But yon proud work no future age shall view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No trace remain where once the glory grew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sapp’d foundations by thy force shall fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, whelm’d beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruin vanish’d, and the name no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus they in heaven: while, o’er the Grecian train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rolling sun descending to the main</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beheld the finish’d work. Their bulls they slew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos’ strands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Bacchus’ blessings cheered the generous bands.</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and
 threatens them with the pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: 
Minerva only obtains of him that she may direct the Greeks by her 
counsels. The armies join battle: Jupiter on Mount Ida weighs in his<a href="#note_189" id="noteref_189" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">189</span></span></a>
 balances the fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his thunders 
and lightnings. Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger: 
Diomed relieves him; whose exploits, and those of Hector, are 
excellently described. Juno endeavours to animate Neptune to the 
assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at 
length wounded by Hector, and carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to 
aid the Grecians, but are restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The 
night puts an end to the battle. Hector continues in the field, (the 
Greeks being driven to their fortifications before the ships,) and gives
 orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy 
from re-embarking and escaping by flight. They kindle fires through all 
the fields, and pass the night under arms.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The time of seven and twenty days is employed 
from the opening of the poem to the end of this book. The scene here 
(except of the celestial machines) lies in the field towards the

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Jove convened the senate of the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where high Olympus’ cloudy tops arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire of gods his awful silence broke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fix’d decree which not all heaven can move;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What god but enters yon forbidden field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gash’d with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With burning chains fix’d to the brazen floors,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lock’d by hell’s inexorable doors;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl’d,<a href="#note_190" id="noteref_190" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">190</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from that centre to the ethereal world.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">League all your forces, then, ye powers above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let down our golden everlasting chain<a href="#note_191" id="noteref_191" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">191</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I fix the chain to great Olympus’ height,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For such I reign, unbounded and above;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A reverend horror silenced all the sky;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling they stood before their sovereign’s look;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O first and greatest! God, by gods adored</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We own thy might, our father and our lord!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, ah! permit to pity human state:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If not to help, at least lament their fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The cloud-compelling god her suit approved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And smiled superior on his best beloved;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then call’d his coursers, and his chariot took;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of heaven’s undrossy gold the gods array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Refulgent, flash’d intolerable day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between the extended earth and starry sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when to Ida’s topmost height he came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where o’er her pointed summits proudly raised,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The town, and tents, and navigable seas.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now had the Grecians snatch’d a short repast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And buckled on their shining arms with haste.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Host against host with shadowy legends drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Victors and vanquish’d join promiscuous cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er heaven’s clear azure spread the sacred light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Commutual death the fate of war confounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,<a href="#note_192" id="noteref_192" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">192</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal hand: in these explored the fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d with its load, the Grecian balance lies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Jove from Ida’s top his horrors spreads;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The clouds burst dreadful o’er the Grecian heads;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unwilling he remain’d, for Paris’ dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in the forehead, where the springing mane</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Curl’d o’er the brow, it stung him to the brain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The encumber’d chariot from the dying steed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pour’d to the tumult on his whirling car.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That day had stretch’d beneath his matchless hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He rush’d, and on Ulysses call’d aloud:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes’ son!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mix’d with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh turn and save from Hector’s direful rage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A single warrior midst a host of foes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the coursers with a sudden spring</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He leap’d, and anxious thus bespoke the king:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These younger champions will oppress thy might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observe the steeds of Tros, renown’d in war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These late obey’d Æneas’ guiding rein;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With these against yon Trojans will we go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thirsty fury of my flying spear.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill’d in war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reverend charioteer directs the course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce he drove on; Tydides whirl’d his spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear with erring haste mistook its way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But plunged in Eniopeus’ bosom lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet unrevenged permits to press the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till, to supply his place and rule the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now had death and horror cover’d all;<a href="#note_193" id="noteref_193" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">193</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roll’d the big thunder o’er the vast profound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in Tydides’ face the lightning flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Nestor’s trembling hand confess’d his fright:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He dropp’d the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, turning, warn’d the intrepid Diomed:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O chief! too daring in thy friend’s defence</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some other sun may see the happier hour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not in man his fix’d decree to move:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great will glory to submit to Jove.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O reverend prince! (Tydides thus replies)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior’s shame!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:<a href="#note_194" id="noteref_194" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">194</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian’s pride?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and, hasty, o’er the gasping throng</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now hope no more those honours from thy train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go less than woman, in the form of man!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice turn’d the chief, and thrice imperial Jove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Ida’s summits thunder’d from above.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your great forefathers’ glories, and your own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pass victorious o’er the levell’d mound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All Greece, encompass’d, in one blaze expires.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious he said; then bending o’er the yoke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Now, Xanthus, Æthon, Lampus, urge the chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all your master’s well-spent care repay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Served with pure wheat, and by a princess’ hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this my spouse, of great Aetion’s line,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So oft has steep’d the strengthening grain in wine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give me to seize rich Nestor’s shield of gold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Tydeus’ shoulders strip the costly load,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia’s soul;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">His purple robe, bright ensign of command.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the midmost bark the king appear’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, from Ulysses’ deck, his voice was heard:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Ajax and Achilles reach’d the sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But who to meet one martial man is found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When the fight rages, and the flames surround?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress’d!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was ever king like me, like me oppress’d?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With power immense, with justice arm’d in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My glory ravish’d, and my people slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What altar smoked not with our victims’ gore?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ask’d destruction to the Trojan name.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give these at least to ’scape from Hector’s hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And save the relics of the Grecian land!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus pray’d the king, and heaven’s great father heard</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gives the people to their monarch’s prayers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A fawn his talons truss’d, (divine portent!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the wondering hosts he soar’d above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then let the prey before his altar fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the broad ditch impell’d his foaming horse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With flying coursers shunn’d his dreadful ire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meriones, like Mars in arms renown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Evaemon’s son next issues to the foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And last young Teucer with his bended bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure behind the Telamonian shield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The skilful archer wide survey’d the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With every shaft some hostile victim slew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retires for safety to the mother’s arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who first by Teucer’s mortal arrows bled?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The godlike Lycophon next press’d the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bloody pile great Melanippus crown’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A Trojan ghost attending every dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy country’s saviour, and thy father’s boast!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from an alien’s bed thy sire to grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud of his boy, he own’d the generous flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the brave son repays his cares with fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now hear a monarch’s vow: If heaven’s high powers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give me to raze Troy’s long-defended towers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whatever treasures Greece for me design,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The next rich honorary gift be thine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall recompense the warrior’s toils with love.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To this the chief: “With praise the rest inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor urge a soul already fill’d with fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What strength I have, be now in battle tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still aim’d at Hector have I bent my bow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But sure some god denies me to destroy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This fury of the field, this dog of Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and twang’d the string. The weapon flies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Hector’s breast, and sings along the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He miss’d the mark; but pierced Gorgythio’s heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drench’d in royal blood the thirsty dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This offspring added to king Priam’s line.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,<a href="#note_196" id="noteref_196" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">196</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Another shaft the raging archer drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That other shaft with erring fury flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(From Hector, Phoebus turn’d the flying wound,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dipp’d its feathers in no vulgar gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector with grief his charioteer beheld</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rush’d on Teucer with the lifted rock.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youth already strain’d the forceful yew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shaft already to his shoulder drew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The feather in his hand, just wing’d for flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Touch’d where the neck and hollow chest unite;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his numb’d hand dismiss’d his useless bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And screen’d his brother with the mighty shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The batter’d archer groaning to the shore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He arm’d their hands, and fill’d their breasts with fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First of the foe, great Hector march’d along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With beating bosom, and with eager pace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus oft the Grecians turn’d, but still they flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When flying they had pass’d the trench profound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the ships a desperate stand they made,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That wither’d all their host: like Mars he stood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then pensive thus, to war’s triumphant maid:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, in this moment of her last despair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Condemn’d to suffer the full force of fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drain the dregs of heaven’s relentless hate?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What power divine shall Hector’s wrath assuage?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spake the imperial regent of the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Long since had Hector stain’d these fields with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d by some Argive on his native shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forgets my service and deserved reward:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By stern Eurystheus with long labours press’d?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He begg’d, with tears he begg’d, in deep dismay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When to grim Pluto’s gloomy gates he went;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The triple dog had never felt his chain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Styx been cross’d, nor hell explored in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Thetis’ suit the partial Thunderer nods;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Juno’s self, and Pallas shall appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She ceased, and Juno rein’d the steeds with care:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Heaven’s awful empress, Saturn’s other heir:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With flowers adorn’d, with art immortal crown’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her father’s arms her mighty limbs invest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His cuirass blazes on her ample breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o’erturns.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven’s gates spontaneous open to the powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven’s golden gates, kept by the winged Hours.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Commission’d in alternate watch they stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sun’s bright portals and the skies command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove, incensed, from Ida’s top survey’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the Thunderer meditates his flight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Ida’s summits to the Olympian height.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swifter than thought, the wheels instinctive fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flame through the vast of air, and reach the sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas Neptune’s charge his coursers to unbrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fix the car on its immortal base;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There stood the chariot, beaming forth its rays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till with a snowy veil he screen’d the blaze.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, whose all-conscious eyes the world behold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The eternal Thunderer sat, enthroned in gold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High heaven the footstool of his feet he makes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wide beneath him all Olympus shakes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling afar the offending powers appear’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused and silent, for his frown they fear’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He saw their soul, and thus his word imparts:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Pallas and Juno! say, why heave your hearts?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon was your battle o’er: proud Troy retired</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before your face, and in your wrath expired.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But know, whoe’er almighty power withstand!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmatch’d our force, unconquer’d is our hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who shall the sovereign of the skies control?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not all the gods that crown the starry pole.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each immortal nerve with horror shake.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For thus I speak, and what I speak shall stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What power soe’er provokes our lifted hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On this our hill no more shall hold his place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cut off, and exiled from the ethereal race.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Juno and Pallas grieving hear the doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But feast their souls on Ilion’s woes to come.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though secret anger swell’d Minerva’s breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prudent goddess yet her wrath repress’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Juno, impotent of rage, replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis thine to punish; ours to grieve alone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Greece we grieve, abandon’d by her fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With arms unaiding see our Argives slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest all should perish in the rage of Jove.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The goddess thus; and thus the god replies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who swells the clouds, and blackens all the skies:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“The morning sun, awaked by loud alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall see the almighty Thunderer in arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What heaps of Argives then shall load the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those radiant eyes shall view, and view in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shall great Hector cease the rage of fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The navy flaming, and thy Greeks in flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even till the day when certain fates ordain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall rise in vengeance, and lay waste the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For such is fate, nor canst thou turn its course</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With all thy rage, with all thy rebel force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly, if thy wilt, to earth’s remotest bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where on her utmost verge the seas resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast by the brink, within the streams of hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No sun e’er gilds the gloomy horrors there;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There arm once more the bold Titanian band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And arm in vain; for what I will, shall stand.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drew behind the cloudy veil of night:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victors keep the field; and Hector calls</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A martial council near the navy walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These to Scamander’s bank apart he led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where thinly scatter’d lay the heaps of dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attend his order, and their prince surround.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A massy spear he bore of mighty strength,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of full ten cubits was the lance’s length;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The point was brass, refulgent to behold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d to the wood with circling rings of gold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The noble Hector on his lance reclined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, bending forward, thus reveal’d his mind:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye valiant Trojans, with attention hear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye Dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And guards them trembling in their wooden walls.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obey the night, and use her peaceful hours</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide o’er the field, high blazing to the sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let numerous fires the absent sun supply,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till the bright morn her purple beam displays;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest, in the silence and the shades of night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not unmolested let the wretches gain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some hostile wound let every dart bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses’ care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And warn their children from a Trojan war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bid the sires with hoary honours crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And beardless youths, our battlements surround.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The insidious foe the naked town invade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector’s hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From these detested foes to free the land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who plough’d, with fates averse, the watery way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Trojan vultures a predestined prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our common safety must be now the care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But soon as morning paints the fields of air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To-morrow’s light (O haste the glorious morn!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From age inglorious, and black death secure;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So might my life and glory know no bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like Pallas worshipp’d, like the sun renown’d!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall crush the Greeks, and end the woes of Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The leader spoke. From all his host around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shouts of applause along the shores resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full hecatombs lay burning on the shore:</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK IX.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Agamemnon, after the last day’s defeat, 
proposes to the Greeks to quit the siege, and return to their country. 
Diomed opposes this, and Nestor seconds him, praising his wisdom and 
resolution. He orders the guard to be strengthened, and a council 
summoned to deliberate what measures are to be followed in this 
emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor further prevails 
upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to move him to a 
reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are accompanied
 by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very moving and pressing 
speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who 
notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The ambassadors return 
unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">This book, and the next following, take up the 
space of one night, which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of 
the poem. The scene lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian 
ships.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus joyful Troy maintain’d the watch of night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,<a href="#note_199" id="noteref_199" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">199</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sat on each face, and sadden’d every heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A double tempest of the west and north</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swells o’er the sea, from Thracia’s frozen shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This way and that the boiling deeps are toss’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such various passions urged the troubled host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Superior sorrows swell’d his royal breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Himself his orders to the heralds bears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bid to council all the Grecian peers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In solemn sadness and majestic grief.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king amidst the mournful circle rose:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So silent fountains, from a rock’s tall head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Words, mix’d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader’s care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fellows in arms and princes of the war!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of partial Jove too justly we complain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heavenly oracles believed in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A safe return was promised to our toils,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With conquest honour’d and enrich’d with spoils:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shameful flight alone can save the host;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And towers and armies humbles to the dust.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste to the joys our native country yields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Silent, unmov’d in dire dismay they stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A pensive scene! till Tydeus’ warlike son</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roll’d on the king his eyes, and thus begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“When kings advise us to renounce our fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First let him speak who first has suffer’d shame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods have made thee but by halves a king:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They gave dominion o’er the seas and land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The noblest power that might the world control</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is this a general’s voice, that would suggest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And if we fly, ’tis what our king commands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A noble care the Grecians shall employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">God bade us fight, and ’twas with God we came.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And voice to voice resounds Tydides’ praise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke: the host in still attention heard:<a href="#note_200" id="noteref_200" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">200</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O truly great! in whom the gods have join’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such strength of body with such force of mind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In conduct, as in courage, you excel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still first to act what you advise so well.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Applauding Greece with common voice approves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yet those years that since thy birth have run</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Would hardly style thee Nestor’s youngest son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then let me add what yet remains behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A thought unfinish’d in that generous mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And solemn swear those charms were only thine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Untouch’d she stay’d, uninjured she removes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These instant shall be thine; and if the powers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give to our arms proud Ilion’s hostile towers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With gold and brass thy loaded navy’s sides.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or yield to Helen’s heavenly charms alone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet hear me further: when our wars are o’er,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If safe we land on Argos’ fruitful shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with Orestes’ self divide his care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet more—three daughters in his court are bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each well worthy of a royal bed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laodice and Iphigenia fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He asks no presents, no reward for love:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Himself will give the dower; so vast a store</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As never father gave a child before.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Enope and Pherae thee obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cardamyle with ample turrets crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The whole extent to Pylos’ sandy plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the verdant margin of the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rule the tributary realms around.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such are the proffers which this day we bring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such the repentance of a suppliant king.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If honour and if interest plead in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If no regard thy suffering country claim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For now that chief, whose unresisted ire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And only triumphs to deserve thy hands.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the goddess-born: “Ulysses, hear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What in my secret soul is understood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dares think one thing, and another tell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My heart detests him as the gates of hell.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then thus in short my fix’d resolves attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretch and hero find their prize the same.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alike regretted in the dust he lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the bold bird her helpless young attends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From danger guards them, and from want defends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In search of prey she wings the spacious air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with the untasted food supplies her care:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I sack’d twelve ample cities on the main,<a href="#note_207" id="noteref_207" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">207</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then at Atrides’ haughty feet were laid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your mighty monarch these in peace possess’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some present, too, to every prince was paid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every prince enjoys the gift he made:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I only must refund, of all his train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See what pre-eminence our merits gain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But what’s the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What to these shores the assembled nations draws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What calls for vengeance but a woman’s cause?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Are fair endowments and a beauteous face</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beloved by none but those of Atreus’ race?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sure every wise and worthy man will love.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrong’d in my love, all proffers I disdain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye have my answer—what remains to do,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What needs he the defence this arm can make?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has he not walls no human force can shake?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has he not fenced his guarded navy round</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And will not these (the wonders he has done)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repel the rage of Priam’s single son?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There was a time (’twas when for Greece I fought)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Hector’s prowess no such wonders wrought;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ fury at the Scaean gate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now those ancient enmities are o’er;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then shall you see our parting vessels crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,<a href="#note_208" id="noteref_208" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">208</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pythia to her Achilles shall restore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wealth he left for this detested shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My beauteous captives thither I’ll convey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all that rests of my unravish’d prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One only valued gift your tyrant gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And that resumed—the fair Lyrnessian slave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For arm’d in impudence, mankind he braves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor share his council, nor his battle join;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For once deceiv’d, was his; but twice were mine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No—let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not though he proffer’d all himself possess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all his rapine could from others wrest:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The many-peopled Orchomenian town;<a href="#note_209" id="noteref_209" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">209</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not all proud Thebes’ unrivall’d walls contain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The world’s great empress on the Egyptian plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(That spreads her conquests o’er a thousand states,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though bribes were heap’d on bribes, in number more</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should all these offers for my friendship call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides’ daughter never shall be led</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(An ill-match’d consort) to Achilles’ bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like golden Venus though she charm’d the heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vied with Pallas in the works of art;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I hate alliance with a tyrant’s race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If heaven restore me to my realms with life,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bless’d in kind love, my years shall glide away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content with just hereditary sway;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not all Apollo’s Pythian treasures hold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Can bribe the poor possession of a day!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And steeds unrivall’d on the dusty plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But from our lips the vital spirit fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Returns no more to wake the silent dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Short is my date, but deathless my renown:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If I return, I quit immortal praise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For years on years, and long-extended days.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove’s arm display’d asserts her from the skies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her hearts are strengthen’d, and her glories rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go then to Greece, report our fix’d design;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One stratagem has fail’d, and others will:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye find, Achilles is unconquer’d still.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go then—digest my message as ye may—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A peaceful death in Pythia’s friendly land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But whether he remain or sail with me,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His age be sacred, and his will be free.”</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">When man rejects the humble suit they make,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Jove commission’d, fierce injustice then</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once fought the Ætolian and Curetian bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard it those; to conquer, these advance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That levell’d harvests, and whole forests tore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Meleager stretch’d along the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Meleager’s thundering arm prevail’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Priests of the gods, and elders of the land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Besought the chief to save the sinking state:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stands relentless, and rejects them all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile the victor’s shouts ascend the skies;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior heard, he vanquish’d, and he saved.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Ætolians, long disdain’d, now took their turn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left the chief their broken faith to mourn.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the 
army, the distress of Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. 
He takes no rest that night, but passes through the camp, awaking the 
leaders, and contriving all possible methods for the public safety. 
Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomed are employed in raising the rest 
of the captains. They call a council of war, and determine to send 
scouts into the enemies’ camp, to learn their posture, and discover 
their intentions. Diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes
 choice of Ulysses for his companion. In their passage they surprise 
Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the 
Grecians. From him they are informed of the situation of the Trojan and 
auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were
 lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of
 his officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince, with which 
they return in triumph to the camp.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lost in sleep the labours of the day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All but the king: with various thoughts oppress’d,<a href="#note_215" id="noteref_215" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">215</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His country’s cares lay rolling in his breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when by lightnings Jove’s ethereal power</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So bursting frequent from Atrides’ breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now o’er the fields, dejected, he surveys</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hears in the passing wind their music blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And marks distinct the voices of the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sues to him that ever lives above:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inly he groans; while glory and despair</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divide his heart, and wage a double war.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What yet remains to save the afflicted state.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A lion’s yellow spoils his back conceal’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile his brother, press’d with equal woes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laments for Greece, that in his cause before</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So much had suffer’d and must suffer more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A leopard’s spotted hide his shoulders spread:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A brazen helmet glitter’d on his head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To wake Atrides in the royal tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already waked, Atrides he descried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His armour buckling at his vessel’s side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why puts my brother his bright armour on?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But say, what hero shall sustain that task?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Guideless, alone, through night’s dark shade to go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And midst a hostile camp explore the foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the king: “In such distress we stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bows his head to Hector’s sacrifice.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What eye has witness’d, or what ear believed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one great day, by one great arm achieved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such wondrous deeds as Hector’s hand has done,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And we beheld, the last revolving sun?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And curse the battle where their fathers fell.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To keep the guards on duty be his care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For Nestor’s influence best that quarter guides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose son with Merion, o’er the watch presides.”)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the Spartan: “These thy orders borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The paths so many, and the camp so wide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urge by their fathers’ fame their future praise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forget we now our state and lofty birth;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To labour is the lot of man below;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, each parted to his several cares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king to Nestor’s sable ship repairs;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sage protector of the Greeks he found</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d in his bed with all his arms around;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The various-colour’d scarf, the shield he rears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dreadful weapons of the warrior’s rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That, old in arms, disdain’d the peace of age.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seek’st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin’d,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And woes, that only with his life shall end!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scarce my heart support its load of pain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fears distracted, with no fix’d design;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all my people’s miseries are mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now let us jointly to the trench descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At every gate the fainting guard excite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else may the sudden foe our works invade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So near, and favour’d by the gloomy shade.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him thus Nestor: “Trust the powers above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor think proud Hector’s hopes confirm’d by Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How ill agree the views of vain mankind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That great Achilles rise and rage again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The care is next our other chiefs to raise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some other be despatch’d of nimbler feet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.<a href="#note_216" id="noteref_216" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">216</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With his great brother in his martial care:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him it behoved to every chief to sue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Preventing every part perform’d by you;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For strong necessity our toils demands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the king: “With reverence we allow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My generous brother is of gentle kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content to follow when we lead the way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now, our ills industrious to prevent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chiefs you named, already at his call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assembling there, between the trench and gates,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For great examples justify command.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, the venerable warrior rose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His purple mantle golden buckles join’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rushing from his tent, he snatch’d in haste</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His steely lance, that lighten’d as he pass’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stopp’d at Ulysses’ tent, and call’d aloud.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whatever means of safety can be sought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, all depend on this important night!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He heard, return’d, and took his painted shield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then join’d the chiefs, and follow’d through the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His head reclining on his bossy shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wood of spears stood by, that, fix’d upright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A bull’s black hide composed the hero’s bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A splendid carpet roll’d beneath his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But sleep’st thou now, when from yon hill the foe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hangs o’er the fleet, and shades our walls below?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now the last despair surrounds our host;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Employ thy youth as I employ my age;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He serves me most, who serves his country best.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, the hero o’er his shoulders flung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A lion’s spoils, that to his ankles hung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, couching close, repel invading sleep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With toil protected from the prowling train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Watch every side, and turn to every sound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus watch’d the Grecians, cautious of surprise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each step of passing feet increased the affright;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Watch thus, and Greece shall live.” The hero said;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then o’er the trench the following chieftains led.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His son, and godlike Merion, march’d behind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For these the princes to their council join’d).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trenches pass’d, the assembled kings around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In silent state the consistory crown’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spot where Hector stopp’d his rage before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When night descending, from his vengeful hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all his progress mark’d by heaps of dead:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The council opening, in these words begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His life to hazard, and his country save?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lives there a man, who singly dares to go</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or favour’d by the night approach so near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If to besiege our navies they prepare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This could he learn, and to our peers recite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pass unharm’d the dangers of the night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What fame were his through all succeeding days,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What gifts his grateful country would bestow!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sable ewe each leader should provide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With each a sable lambkin by her side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At every rite his share should be increased,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his the foremost honours of the feast.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides spoke—“The man you seek is here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some god within commands, and I obey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let some other chosen warrior join,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To raise my hopes, and second my design.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By mutual confidence and mutual aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one brave hero fans another’s fire.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Contending leaders at the word arose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each generous breast with emulation glows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Merion strove, and Nestor’s valiant heir;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Spartan wish’d the second place to gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Ulysses wish’d, nor wish’d in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the king of men the contest ends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In this great enterprise, is only thine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just be thy choice, without affection made;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To birth, or office, no respect be paid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let worth determine here.” The monarch spake,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And inly trembled for his brother’s sake.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My choice declares the impulse of my mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To lend his counsels and assist our hands?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A chief, whose safety is Minerva’s care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bless’d in his conduct, I no aid require;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Are lost on hearers that our merits know.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let us haste—Night rolls the hours away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reddening orient shows the coming day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And of night’s empire but a third remains.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Short of its crest, and with no plume o’erspread:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft wool within; without, in order spread,<a href="#note_217" id="noteref_217" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">217</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A boar’s white teeth grinn’d horrid o’er his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Molus received, the pledge of social ties;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The helmet next by Merion was possess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now Ulysses’ thoughtful temples press’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dark through paths oblique their progress take.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just then, in sign she favour’d their intent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A long-wing’d heron great Minerva sent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This, though surrounding shades obscured their view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from the right she soar’d, Ulysses pray’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hail’d the glad omen, and address’d the maid:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O daughter of that god whose arm can wield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O thou! for ever present in my way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who all my motions, all my toils survey!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe by thy succour to our ships convey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let some deed this signal night adorn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then godlike Diomed preferr’d his prayer:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Daughter of Jove, unconquer’d Pallas! hear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As thou defend’st the sire, defend the son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When on Æsopus’ banks the banded powers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He went a legate, but return’d a foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then help’d by thee, and cover’d by thy shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So now be present, O celestial maid!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So still continue to the race thine aid!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heroes pray’d, and Pallas from the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, like two lions panting for the prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through dust, through blood, o’er arms, and hills of slain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On high designs the wakeful hours employ;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If now subdued they meditate their flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His be the chariot that shall please him most,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all the plunder of the vanquish’d host;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his the glory to have served so well.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dolon his name, Eumedes’ only boy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not bless’d by nature with the charms of face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This high achievement, and explore the fleet:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And swear to grant me the demanded prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even to the royal tent pursue my way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all their counsels, all their aims betray.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And him alone the immortal steeds adorn.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus Hector swore: the gods were call’d in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Across his back the bended bow he flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wolf’s grey hide around his shoulders hung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A ferret’s downy fur his helmet lined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then (never to return) he sought the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trod the path his feet must tread no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce had he pass’d the steeds and Trojan throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses mark’d, and thus to Diomed;</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet let him pass, and win a little space;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if too swift of foot he flies before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confine his course along the fleet and shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And intercept his hoped return to Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that they stepp’d aside, and stoop’d their head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(As Dolon pass’d,) behind a heap of dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the path the spy unwary flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So distant they, and such the space between,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when two teams of mules divide the green,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector (he thought) had sent, and check’d his haste,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till scarce at distance of a javelin’s throw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from the herd still turn the flying prey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When brave Tydides stopp’d; a gen’rous thought</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus aloud: “Whoe’er thou art, remain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and high in air the weapon cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which wilful err’d, and o’er his shoulder pass’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fix’d in earth. Against the trembling wood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretch stood propp’d, and quiver’d as he stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden palsy seized his turning head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His loose teeth chatter’d, and his colour fled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting warriors seize him as he stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with unmanly tears his life demands.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And steel well-temper’d and refulgent gold.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Whoe’er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To roam the silent fields in dead of night?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cam’st thou the secrets of our camp to find,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hither I came, by Hector’s words deceived;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Much did he promise, rashly I believed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No less a bribe than great Achilles’ car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where lies encamp’d the Trojan chief to-night?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or here to combat, from their city far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or back to Ilion’s walls transfer the war?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes’ son:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A council holds at Ilus’ monument.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No certain guards the nightly watch partake;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where’er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discharge their souls of half the fears of war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Inquired the chief,) or scattered o’er the plain?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the spy: “Their powers they thus dispose</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Leleges, encamp along the coast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not distant far, lie higher on the land</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Lycian, Mysian, and Maeonian band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Phrygia’s horse, by Thymbras’ ancient wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Thracians utmost, and apart from all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These Troy but lately to her succour won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Led on by Rhesus, great Eioneus’ son:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I saw his coursers in proud triumph go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rich silver plates his shining car infold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Celestial panoply, to grace a god!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or leave me here, a captive’s fate to mourn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In cruel chains, till your return reveal</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The truth or falsehood of the news I tell.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or that again our camps thou may’st explore?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No—once a traitor, thou betray’st no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One instant snatch’d his trembling soul to hell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The head, yet speaking, mutter’d as it fell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The furry helmet from his brow they tear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wolf’s grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O speed our labours, and direct our ways!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then heap’d with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guide their footsteps to the place again.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the still night they cross the devious fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slippery with blood, o’er arms and heaps of shields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And eased in sleep the labours of the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their arms in order on the ground reclined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch’d in sleep profound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the white steeds behind his chariot bound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And points to Diomed the tempting prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“The man, the coursers, and the car behold!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Described by Dolon, with the arms of gold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach the chariot, and the steeds untie;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas (this said) her hero’s bosom warms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where’er he pass’d, a purple stream pursued</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And a low groan remurmur’d through the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So the grim lion, from his nightly den,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor stopp’d the fury of his vengeful hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses following, as his partner slew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back by the foot each slaughter’d warrior drew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The milk-white coursers studious to convey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now twelve despatch’d, the monarch last they found;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides’ falchion fix’d him to the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A warlike form appear’d before his tent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So dream’d the monarch, and awaked no more.<a href="#note_218" id="noteref_218" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">218</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leads them, fasten’d by the silver reins;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, with his bow unbent, he lash’d along;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The scourge forgot, on Rhesus’ chariot hung;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then gave his friend the signal to retire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To send more heroes to the infernal shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drag off the car where Rhesus’ armour lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or heave with manly force, and lift away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas appears, and thus her chief commands:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The voice divine confess’d the martial maid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In haste he mounted, and her word obey’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coursers fly before Ulysses’ bow,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not unobserved they pass’d: the god of light</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had watch’d his Troy, and mark’d Minerva’s flight,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vengeful anger fill’d his sacred breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(On Rhesus’ side accustom’d to attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He rose, and saw the field deform’d with blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An empty space where late the coursers stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now while on Rhesus’ name he calls in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gathering tumult spreads o’er all the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wondering view the slaughters of the night.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where late the spoils of Hector’s spy were laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses stopp’d; to him Tydides bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon’s gore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thickening this way, and gathering on my ear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Tydides and Ulysses bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Return’d triumphant with this prize of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chiefs outnumber’d by the Trojan train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With words of friendship and extended hands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spoil of foes, or present of a god?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old as I am, to age I scorn to yield,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But sure till now no coursers struck my sight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bless’d as ye are, and favourites of the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The care of him who bids the thunder roar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And her, whose fury bathes the world with gore.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin’d,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sleeping he died, with all his guards around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These other spoils from conquer’d Dolon came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Hector sent our forces to explore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He now lies headless on the sandy shore.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then o’er the trench the bounding coursers flew;</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK XI.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the 
Grecians to battle; Hector prepares the Trojans to receive them, while 
Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all 
before him and Hector is commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that 
purpose) to decline the engagement, till the king shall be wounded and 
retire from the field. He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. 
Ulysses and Diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter, being 
wounded by Paris, is obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed
 by the Trojans, wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and 
Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes 
multitudes, and rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the 
other wing of the army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried 
from the fight in Nestor’s chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action 
from his ship) sent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded
 in that manner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of 
the accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which 
he remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to 
fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in 
Achilles’ armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also 
wounded, and assists him in that distress.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth 
day of the poem, and the same day, with its various actions and 
adventures is extended through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, 
fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The
 scene lies in the field near the monument of Ilus.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,<a href="#note_219" id="noteref_219" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">219</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now rose refulgent from Tithonus’ bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When baleful Eris, sent by Jove’s command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The torch of discord blazing in her hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, wrapt in tempests, o’er the fleet descends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on Ulysses’ bark her horrid stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She took, and thunder’d through the seas and land.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more they sigh, inglorious to return,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of men his hardy host inspires</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With loud command, with great example fires!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Himself first rose, himself before the rest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first he cased his manly legs around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In shining greaves with silver buckles bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The beaming cuirass next adorn’d his breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The same which once king Cinyras possess’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The fame of Greece and her assembled host</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">This glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ten rows of azure steel the work infold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose imitated scales against the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Reflected various light, and arching bow’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Jove’s wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His buckler’s mighty orb was next display’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tremendous Gorgon frown’d upon its field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And circling terrors fill’d the expressive shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Within its concave hung a silver thong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On which a mimic serpent creeps along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His azure length in easy waves extends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till in three heads the embroider’d monster ends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Last o’er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in his hands two steely javelins wields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That instant Juno, and the martial maid,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close to the limits of the trench and mound,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The woes of men unwilling to survey,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near Ilus’ tomb, in order ranged around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan lines possess’d the rising ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There wise Polydamas and Hector stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas, honour’d as a guardian god;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brother-warriors of Antenor’s line:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fair proportion match’d the ethereal race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector, cover’d with his spacious shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Plies all the troops, and orders all the field.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discord with joy the scene of death descries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discord alone, of all the immortal train,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But general murmurs told their griefs above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each accused the partial will of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fix’d, fulfill’d the just decrees of fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On earth he turn’d his all-considering eyes,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These words, attended with the flood of tears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youths address’d to unrelenting ears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The daring wretch who once in council stood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To shed Ulysses’ and my brother’s blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For proffer’d peace! and sues his seed for grace?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, Pisander from the car he cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His brother leap’d to earth; but, as he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trenchant falchion lopp’d his hands away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sever’d head was toss’d among the throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king’s example all his Greeks pursue.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brass-hoof’d steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The distanced army wonders at his deeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the winds with raging flames conspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er the forests roll the flood of fire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In blazing heaps the grove’s old honours fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one refulgent ruin levels all:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before Atrides’ rage so sinks the foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And many a car, now lighted of its lord,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide o’er the field with guideless fury rolls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While his keen falchion drinks the warriors’ lives;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove and destiny prolong’d his date.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the mid field the routed urge their way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The path they take, and speed to reach the town.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero halts, and his associates waits.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile on every side around the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dispersed, disorder’d, fly the Trojan train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lion’s roaring through the midnight shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On heaps they tumble with successless haste;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still press’d the rout, and still the hindmost slew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hurl’d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And down their summits pour’d a hundred rills:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To godlike Hector this our word convey—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trust the war to less important hands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till to the main the burning sun descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sacred night her awful shade extend.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and Iris at his word obey’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On wings of winds descends the various maid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The goddess then: “O son of Priam, hear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trust the war to less important hands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till to the main the burning sun descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sacred night her awful shade extend.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She said, and vanish’d. Hector, with a bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fight renew’d with fiercer fury burns:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And learn from him to conquer, or to die.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And early honour warm his generous breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When the kind sire consign’d his daughter’s charms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Theano’s sister) to his youthful arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But call’d by glory to the wars of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And swift to aid his dearer country flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With twelve black ships he reach’d Percope’s strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence took the long laborious march by land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides first discharged the missive spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan stoop’d, the javelin pass’d in air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then near the corslet, at the monarch’s heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The point rebated, and repell’d the wound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Encumber’d with the dart, Atrides stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till, grasp’d with force, he wrench’d it from his hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once his weighty sword discharged a wound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his neck, that fell’d him to the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy country’s friend; and virtuous, though in vain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more the youth shall join his consort’s side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once a virgin, and at once a bride!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more with presents her embraces meet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On whom his passion, lavish of his store,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bestow’d so much, and vainly promised more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unwept, uncover’d, on the plain he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the proud victor bore his arms away.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Coon, Antenor’s eldest hope, was nigh:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the pale features now deform’d with blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Aim’d at the king, and near his elbow strook.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His brother’s corpse the pious Trojan draws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And calls his country to assert his cause;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er the body spreads his ample shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides, marking an unguarded part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Transfix’d the warrior with his brazen dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on his brother’s bleeding breast he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch’s falchion lopp’d his head away:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The social shades the same dark journey go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And join each other in the realms below.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vengeful victor rages round the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With every weapon art or fury yields:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o’erthrown.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This, while yet warm distill’d the purple flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The powers that cause the teeming matron’s throes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with a voice which fury made more strong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And envies half the glories of the day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from their sides the foam descends in snow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot through the battle in a moment’s space,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wounded monarch at his tent they place.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No sooner Hector saw the king retired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your great forefathers’ virtues, and your own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With words like these the fiery chief alarms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fainting host, and every bosom warms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the black body of the foe he pours;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from the cloud’s deep bosom, swell’d with showers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan’s glory crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opites next was added to their side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dispels the gather’d clouds that Notus forms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gust continued, violent and strong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now the last ruin the whole host appals;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But wise Ulysses call’d Tydides forth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Hector’s arm involve the ships in flame?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, let us join, and combat side by side.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sigh’d; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His death ennobled by Ulysses’ sword.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There slain, they left them in eternal night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Hector’s conquests in the middle plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stood check’d awhile, and Greece respired again.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Towering they rode in one refulgent car:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In deep prophetic arts their father skill’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had warn’d his children from the Trojan field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fate urged them on: the father warn’d in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They rush’d to fight, and perish’d on the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Tydeus’ lance Agastrophus was slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wing’d with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fled, but flying left his life behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shouts, as he pass’d, the crystal regions rend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And moving armies on his march attend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus bespoke his brother of the war:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here stand his utmost force.”—The warrior said;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor miss’d its aim, but where the plumage danced</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus’ hands)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But yet so stunn’d, that, staggering on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides followed to regain his lance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Hector rose, recover’d from the trance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And oft that partial power has lent his aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If any god assist Tydides’ hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, while he triumph’d, Paris eyed from far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the fields his feather’d shafts he sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From ancient Ilus’ ruin’d monument:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wing’d an arrow at the unwary foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just as he stoop’d, Agastrophus’s crest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bowstring twang’d; nor flew the shaft in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But pierced his foot, and nail’d it to the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Would the same god had fix’d it in his heart!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As scatter’d lambs the rushing lion fear.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He dauntless thus: “Thou conqueror of the fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unskill’d in arms to act a manly part!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou hast but done what boys or women can;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A coward’s weapon never hurts the brave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so this dart, which thou may’st one day feel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where this but lights, some noble life expires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leaves such objects as distract the fair.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But stands collected in himself, and whole,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And questions thus his own unconquer’d soul:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What danger, singly if I stand the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My friends all scatter’d, all the foes around?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To die or conquer, proves a hero’s heart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, knowing this, I know a soldier’s part.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round him deep the steely circle grows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By these, by those, on every part is plied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the red slaughter spreads on every side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses reach’d him with the fatal spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But to his aid his brother Socus flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not deeper skill’d in every martial sleight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And end at once the great Hippasian race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or thou beneath this lance must press the field.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Plough’d half his side, and bared it to the bone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Pallas’ care, the spear, though deep infix’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stopp’d short of life, nor with his entrails mix’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fate calls thee hence and finish’d is thy race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And add one spectre to the realms below!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling gave way, and turn’d his back to flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And held its passage through the panting heart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide in his breast appear’d the grisly wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He falls; his armour rings against the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There ends thy narrow span assign’d by fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hovering vultures scream around their prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then raging with intolerable smart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gladden’d Troy with sight of hostile blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alarm’d, to Ajax Telamon he cried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who shares his labours, and defends his side:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O friend! Ulysses’ shouts invade my ear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oppress’d by multitudes, the best may fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece robb’d of him must bid her host despair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And feel a loss not ages can repair.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prudent chief in sore distress they found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With bands of furious Trojans compass’d round.<a href="#note_223" id="noteref_223" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">223</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till life’s warm vapour issuing through the wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lion rushes through the woodland shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lordly savage vindicates his prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses thus, unconquer’d by his pains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A single warrior half a host sustains:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scattered crowds fly frighted o’er the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides’ arm the sinking hero stays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first Doryclus, Priam’s son, he slew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a torrent, swell’d with wintry rains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pours from the mountains o’er the deluged plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A country’s ruins! to the seas are borne:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce Ajax thus o’erwhelms the yielding throng;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior’s fury; there the battle glows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There fierce on foot, or from the chariot’s height,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling Greece for her physician fear’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Glory of Greece, old Neleus’ valiant son!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Machaon to the ships convey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wise physician skill’d our wounds to heal,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is more than armies to the public weal.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wounded offspring of the healing god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now Cebriones, from Hector’s car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Survey’d the various fortune of the war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before great Ajax see the mingled throng</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I know him well, distinguish’d o’er the field</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having spoke, the driver’s lash resounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The horses’ hoofs are bathed in heroes’ gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, dashing, purple all the car before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The groaning axle sable drops distils,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ranks he scatter’d and the troops o’erthrown:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But partial Jove, espousing Hector’s part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian’s heart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused, unnerved in Hector’s presence grown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er his broad back his moony shield he threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So turn’d stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While his swoln heart at every step rebell’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The patient animal maintains his ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And threats his followers with retorted eye.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d as the bar between two warring powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While hissing darts descend in iron showers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose eager javelin launch’d against the foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his torn liver the red current flow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his slack knees desert their dying load.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor rushing to despoil the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Paris’ bow a vengeful arrow fled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d was the point, but broken was the wood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay’d?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh, turn to arms; ’tis Ajax claims your aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And this the last brave battle he shall wage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior rescue, and your country save.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each takes new courage at the hero’s sight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero rallies, and renews the fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Nestor’s chariot far from fight retires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His coursers steep’d in sweat, and stain’d with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks’ preserver, great Machaon, bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That hour Achilles, from the topmost height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of his proud fleet, o’erlook’d the fields of fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His feasted eyes beheld around the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friend Machaon singled from the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A transient pity touch’d his vengeful breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Straight to Menoetius’ much-loved son he sent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fix’d the date of all his woes to come.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er thy will, Patroclus shall obey.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still at my heart, and ever at my side!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The time is come, when yon despairing host</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall learn the value of the man they lost:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His form recall’d Machaon to my mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coursers pass’d me with so swift a pace.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero said. His friend obey’d with haste,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through intermingled ships and tents he pass’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chiefs descending from their car he found:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warriors standing on the breezy shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Convey’d that freshness the cool seas exhale;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to consult on farther methods went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And took their seats beneath the shady tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arsinous’ daughter, graced with golden hairs:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece, as the prize of Nestor’s wisdom gave:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A table first with azure feet she placed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Honey new-press’d, the sacred flour of wheat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wholesome garlic, crown’d the savoury treat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From eldest times: emboss’d with studs of gold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two feet support it, and four handles hold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On each bright handle, bending o’er the brink,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When the brisk nectar overlook’d the brim.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Temper’d in this, the nymph of form divine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With goat’s-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And last with flour the smiling surface strows:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Salubrious draughts the warriors’ thirst allay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pleasing conference beguiles the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To his high seat: the chief refused and said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis now no season for these kind delays;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Achilles with impatience stays.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To great Achilles this respect I owe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This to report, my hasty course I bend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou know’st the fiery temper of my friend.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Excite compassion in Achilles’ mind?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This is not half the story of our woe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now the slow course of all-impairing time</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch’d the great Itymonaeus dead!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ours was all the plunder of the plains:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As many goats, as many lowing kine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thrice the number of unrivall’d steeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All teeming females, and of generous breeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, as my first essay of arms, I won;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When the proud Elians first commenced the war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Neleus’ sons Alcides’ rage had slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oppress’d, we arm’d; and now this conquest gain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(That large reprisal he might justly claim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Elis’ monarch, at the public course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Detain’d his chariot, and victorious horse.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest the people shared; myself survey’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The just partition, and due victims paid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With many a courser, and with many a car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Actor at their army’s head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stream they pass’d, and pitch’d their tents below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas, descending in the shades of night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fear’d for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stopp’d my chariot, and detain’d my arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Along fair Arene’s delightful plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To great Alphaeus’ sacred source we came.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the blue monarch of the watery main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms we slept, beside the winding flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While round the town the fierce Epeians stood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">King Augias’ son, and spouse of Agamede:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(She that all simples’ healing virtues knew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every herb that drinks the morning dew:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I seized his car, the van of battle led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Actor’s sons had died, but Neptune shrouds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er heapy shields, and o’er the prostrate throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where o’er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Pallas stopp’d us where Alisium flows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the same arm that led concludes the day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There to high Jove were public thanks assign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such then I was, impell’d by youthful blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So proved my valour for my country’s good.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Achilles with unactive fury glows,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O friend! my memory recalls the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I, and Ulysses, touch’d at Phthia’s port,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And entered Peleus’ hospitable court.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pour’d libations on the flaming thighs.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Menoetius, turn’d the fragments on the fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Social we sit, and share the genial rites.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We then explained the cause on which we came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Peleus said only this:—‘My son! be brave.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Menoetius thus: ‘Though great Achilles shine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In strength superior, and of race divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spoke your father at Thessalia’s court:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Words now forgot, though now of vast import.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some favouring god Achilles’ heart may move;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If some dire oracle his breast alarm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clad in Achilles’ arms, if thou appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d by fresh forces, her o’er-labour’d train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This touch’d his generous heart, and from the tent</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the shore with hasty strides he went;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The public mart and courts of justice stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And altars to the guardian gods arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, sad, he met the brave Euaemon’s son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large painful drops from all his members run;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An arrow’s head yet rooted in his wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sable blood in circles mark’d the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As faintly reeling he confess’d the smart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine compassion touch’d Patroclus’ breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from your friends, and from your native shore?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resists she yet the raging Hector’s hand?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or are her heroes doom’d to die with shame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And this the period of our wars and fame?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eurypylus replies: “No more, my friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece is no more! this day her glories end;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her force increasing as her toil renews.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With lukewarm water wash the gore away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With healing balms the raging smart allay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Machaon, wounded in his tent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now wants that succour which so oft he lent.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the chief: “What then remains to do?</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Charged by Achilles’ great command I fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bear with haste the Pylian king’s reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thy distress this instant claims relief.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and in his arms upheld the chief.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The slaves their master’s slow approach survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hides of oxen on the floor display’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There stretch’d at length the wounded hero lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus cut the forky steel away:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wound he wash’d, the styptic juice infused.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The Greeks having retired into their 
intrenchments, Hector attempts to force them; but it proving impossible 
to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises to quit their chariots, and manage 
the attack on foot. The Trojans follow his counsel; and having divided 
their army into five bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the 
signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the 
left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. 
This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many 
actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, 
casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters 
at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to 
their ships.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus the hero’s pious cares attend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The cure and safety of his wounded friend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without the gods, how short a period stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The proudest monument of mortal hands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This stood while Hector and Achilles raged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when her sons were slain, her city burn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And what survived of Greece to Greece return’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Ida’s summits pour’d their watery store;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Caresus roaring down the stony hills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main<a href="#note_224" id="noteref_224" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">224</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, turn’d by Phoebus from their wonted ways,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deluged the rampire nine continual days;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of ocean, marching stern before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now smooth’d with sand, and levell’d by the flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In their old bounds the rivers roll again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shine ’twixt the hills, or wander o’er the plain.<a href="#note_225" id="noteref_225" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">225</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But this the gods in later times perform;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War thunder’d at the gates, and blood distain’d the towers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector’s approach in every wind they hear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector’s fury every moment fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, like a whirlwind, toss’d the scattering throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So ’midst the dogs and hunters’ daring bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d foes around a dreadful circle form,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And where he turns the rout disperse or die:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal rage encompass’d Hector glows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eager they view’d the prospect dark and deep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bristled thick with sharpen’d stakes below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foot alone this strong defence could force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And try the pass impervious to the horse.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restrain’d great Hector, and this counsel gave:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On certain dangers we too rashly run:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If ’tis his will our haughty foes to tame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one great day destroy and bury all!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But should they turn, and here oppress our train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one promiscuous carnage crush’d and bruised,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour.”</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief’s example follow’d by his train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By orders strict the charioteers enjoin’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The forces part in five distinguish’d bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all obey their several chiefs’ commands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best and bravest in the first conspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector glorious in the van of these,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the next the graceful Paris shines,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Priam with the third appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whom Arisba’s yellow coursers bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coursers fed on Selle’s winding shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antenor’s sons the fourth battalion guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Æneas, born on fountful Ide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine Sarpedon the last band obey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next him, the bravest, at their army’s head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he more brave than all the hosts he led.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now with compacted shields in close array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The moving legions speed their headlong way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While every Trojan thus, and every aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The advice of wise Polydamas obey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Asius alone, confiding in his car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those wheels returning ne’er shall mark the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more those coursers with triumphant joy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restore their master to the gates of Troy!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gates half-open’d to receive the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His following host with clamours rend the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who from the Lapiths’ warlike race descend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Polypoetes, great Perithous’ heir,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And that Leonteus, like the god of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the hills appears their stately form,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So graceful these, and so the shock they stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of raging Asius, and his furious band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain around them beat their hollow shields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard their navies, and defend the wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even when they saw Troy’s sable troops impend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth from the portals rush’d the intrepid pair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So two wild boars spring furious from their den,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On every side the crackling trees they tear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Maintain’d the walls, and mann’d the lofty towers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To save their fleet their last efforts they try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dreary winter on his frozen wings;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Descend, and whiten all the fields below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fast the darts on either army pour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heavy, and thick, resound the batter’d shields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“In powers immortal who shall now believe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What man could doubt but Troy’s victorious power</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard the entrance of their common hive,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A race determined, that to death contend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repel an army, and defraud the fates?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These empty accents mingled with the wind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor moved great Jove’s unalterable mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To godlike Hector and his matchless might</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was owed the glory of the destined fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the gates sustain’d an equal tide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spirit of a god my breast inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Greece unconquer’d kept alive the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure of death, confiding in despair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With unassisting arms deplored the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First Damasus, by Polypoetes’ steel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through his helmet’s brazen visor, fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round him rose a monument of dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Heaven alarm’d, by prodigies amazed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A signal omen stopp’d the passing host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their martial fury in their wonder lost.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove’s bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A bleeding serpent of enormous size,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His talons truss’d; alive, and curling round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In airy circles wings his painful way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Jove’s portent with beating hearts behold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then first Polydamas the silence broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long weigh’d the signal, and to Hector spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">True to those counsels which I judge the best,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To speak his thoughts is every freeman’s right,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all I move, deferring to thy sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But tends to raise that power which I obey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus my mind explains its clear event:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor eagle, whose sinister flight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dismiss’d his conquest in the middle skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Allow’d to seize, but not possess the prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For thus a skilful seer would read the skies.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him then Hector with disdain return’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn’d:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What coward counsels would thy madness move</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against the word, the will reveal’d of Jove?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And happy thunders of the favouring god,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By wandering birds that flit with every wind?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or where the suns arise, or where descend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To right, to left, unheeded take your way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While I the dictates of high heaven obey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And asks no omen but his country’s cause.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But why should’st thou suspect the war’s success?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">None fears it more, as none promotes it less:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy and her sons may find a general grave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spread their cold poison through our soldiers’ breasts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My javelin can revenge so base a part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And free the soul that quivers in thy heart.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Calls on his host; his host obey the call;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With ardour follow where their leader flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gives great Hector the predestined day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While these they undermine, and those they rend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The generous impulse every Greek obeys;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since not alike endued with force or art;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold a day when each may act his part!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To gain new glories, or augment the old.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drown Hector’s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Jove once more may drive their routed train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy lie trembling in her walls again.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the stones descend in heavier showers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In winter’s bleak uncomfortable reign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A snowy inundation hides the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first the mountain-tops are cover’d o’er,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one bright waste hides all the works of men:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The circling seas, alone absorbing all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from each side increased the stony rain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the white ruin rises o’er the plain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till great Sarpedon tower’d amid the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bears aloft his ample shield in air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So press’d with hunger, from the mountain’s brow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Descends a lion on the flocks below;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stalks the lordly savage o’er the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shepherds gall him with an iron war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With generous rage that drives him on the foes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He views the towers, and meditates their fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then casting on his friend an ardent look,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,<a href="#note_226" id="noteref_226" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">226</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Xanthus’ streams enrich the Lycian plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our feasts enhanced with music’s sprightly sound?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why on those shores are we with joy survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Admired as heroes, and as gods obey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unless great acts superior merit prove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vindicate the bounteous powers above?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first in valour, as the first in place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That when with wondering eyes our martial bands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold our deeds transcending our commands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom those that envy dare not imitate!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For lust of fame I should not vainly dare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But since, alas! ignoble age must come,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Disease, and death’s inexorable doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The life, which others pay, let us bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And give to fame what we to nature owe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brave though we fall, and honour’d if we live,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or let us glory gain, or glory give!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; his words the listening chief inspire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior’s fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The troops pursue their leaders with delight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Menestheus from on high the storm beheld</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the walls he gazed, to view from far</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What aid appear’d to avert the approaching war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus to Thoos: “Hence with speed (he said),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their strength, united, best may help to bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bloody labours of the doubtful war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best and bravest of the hostile force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if too fiercely there the foes contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Teucer haste with his unerring bow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To share the danger, and repel the foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus’ son demands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your strength, united, best may help to bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bloody labours of the doubtful war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best and bravest of the hostile force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At least, let Telamon those towers defend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Teucer haste with his unerring bow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To share the danger, and repel the foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Straight to the fort great Ajax turn’d his care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To you I trust the fortune of the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till by this arm the foe shall be repell’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That done, expect me to complete the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal steps bold Teucer press’d the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the walls appear’d the Lycian powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks, oppress’d, their utmost force unite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The war renews, mix’d shouts and groans arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sarpedon’s friend. Across the warrior’s way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In modern ages not the strongest swain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He poised, and swung it round; then toss’d on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It flew with force, and labour’d up the sky;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the Lycian’s helmet thundering down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ponderous ruin crush’d his batter’d crown.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As skilful divers from some airy steep</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Teucer’s hand a winged arrow flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bearded shaft the destined passage found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief, who fear’d some foe’s insulting boast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Might stop the progress of his warlike host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Conceal’d the wound, and, leaping from his height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retired reluctant from the unfinish’d fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His beating breast with generous ardour glows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alcmaon first was doom’d his force to feel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then from the yawning wound with fury tore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His brazen armour rings against the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to the battlement the victor flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rolling ruins smoke along the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in his belt the feather’d weapon stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove was present in the dire debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prince gave back, not meditating flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But urging vengeance, and severer fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then raised with hope, and fired with glory’s charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The breach lies open, but your chief in vain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The force of powerful union conquers all.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fix’d support the weight of all the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As on the confines of adjoining grounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One foot, one inch, of the contended field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The copious slaughter covers all the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the high ramparts drip with human gore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From side to side the trembling balance nods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(While some laborious matron, just and poor,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:<a href="#note_227" id="noteref_227" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">227</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stood the war, till Hector’s matchless might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fates prevailing, turn’d the scale of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fires his host with loud repeated cries.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the works a wood of glittering spears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pointed above, and rough and gross below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such men as live in these degenerate days:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The snowy fleece, he toss’d, and shook in air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Jove upheld, and lighten’d of its load</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus arm’d, before the folded gates he came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On lofty beams of solid timber hung:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The folds are shatter’d; from the crackling door</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:<a href="#note_228" id="noteref_228" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">228</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his eye-balls flash’d the living flame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He moves a god, resistless in his course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seems a match for more than mortal force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then pouring after, through the gaping space,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shore is heap’d with death, and tumult rends the sky.</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Neptune, concerned for the loss of the 
Grecians, upon seeing the fortification forced by Hector, (who had 
entered the gate near the station of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of 
Calchas, and inspires those heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of 
one of the generals, encourages the other Greeks who had retired to 
their vessels. The Ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a
 stop to Hector and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; 
Meriones, losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at 
the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two 
warriors, who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his 
courage above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: 
Deiphobus and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. 
Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on
 the left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till, 
being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to 
call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to 
rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again, 
and renews the attack.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the Grecian wall and the sea-shore.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had fix’d great Hector and his conquering host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He left them to the fates, in bloody fray</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then turn’d to Thracia from the field of fight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those eyes that shed insufferable light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To where the Mysians prove their martial force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Renown’d for justice and for length of days;<a href="#note_229" id="noteref_229" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">229</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No aid, he deems, to either host is given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime the monarch of the watery main</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Samothracia, on a mountain’s brow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose waving woods o’erhung the deeps below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Ida’s misty tops confusedly rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Below, fair Ilion’s glittering spires were seen;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The crowded ships and sable seas between.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, from the crystal chambers of the main</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Emerged, he sat, and mourn’d his Argives slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone down the rocky steep he rush’d along;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as he pass’d, the lofty mountains nod,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From realm to realm three ample strides he took,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, at the fourth, the distant Ægae shook.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far in the bay his shining palace stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This having reach’d, his brass-hoof’d steeds he reins,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fleet as the winds, and deck’d with golden manes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Immortal arms of adamant and gold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sits superior, and the chariot flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The enormous monsters rolling o’er the deep</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gambol around him on the watery way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heavy whales in awkward measures play;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The parting waves before his coursers fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wondering waters leave his axle dry.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between where Tenedos the surges lave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There the great ruler of the azure round</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stopp’d his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And link’d their fetlocks with a golden band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The father of the floods pursues his way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Embattled roll’d, as Hector rush’d along:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They vow destruction to the Grecian name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in their hopes the fleets already flame.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On other works though Troy with fury fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pour her armies o’er our batter’d wall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There Greece has strength: but this, this part o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her strength were vain; I dread for you alone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here Hector rages like the force of fire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet some heavenly power your breast excite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece yet may live, her threaten’d fleet maintain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector’s force, and Jove’s own aid, be vain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He touch’d the chiefs, and steel’d their manly souls:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, as a falcon from the rocky height,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wide horizon shut him from their view.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The inspiring god Oileus’ active son</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perceived the first, and thus to Telamon:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Some god, my friend, some god in human form</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not Calchas this, the venerable seer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Short as he turned, I saw the power appear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I mark’d his parting, and the steps he trod;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His own bright evidence reveals a god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even now some energy divine I share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“With equal ardour (Telamon returns)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">New rising spirits all my force alarm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Singly, methinks, yon towering chief I meet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full of the god that urged their burning breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heroes thus their mutual warmth express’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And swarms victorious o’er their yielding walls:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling before the impending storm they lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While tears of rage stand burning in their eye.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But breathe new courage as they feel the power.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Merion next, the impulsive fury found;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Last Nestor’s son the same bold ardour takes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus the god the martial fire awakes:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I trusted in the gods, and you, to see</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brave Greece victorious, and her navy free:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah, no—the glorious combat you disclaim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one black day clouds all her former fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unseen, unthought, till this amazing day!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly we at length from Troy’s oft-conquer’d bands?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A rout undisciplined, a straggling train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not born to glories of the dusty plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A prey to every savage of the wood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall these, so late who trembled at your name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soldiers’ baseness, or the general’s fault?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fools! will ye perish for your leader’s vice;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The purchase infamy, and life the price?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not your cause, Achilles’ injured fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Another’s is the crime, but yours the shame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grant that our chief offend through rage or lust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Must you be cowards, if your king’s unjust?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prevent this evil, and your country save:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Think, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I waste no anger, for they feel no shame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But you, the pride, the flower of all our host,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On endless infamy, on instant death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impetuous Hector thunders at the wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These words the Grecians’ fainting hearts inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And listening armies catch the godlike fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d at his post was each bold Ajax found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So close their order, so disposed their fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As Pallas’ self might view with fix’d delight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or had the god of war inclined his eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of war had own’d a just surprise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Descending Hector and his battle wait.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An iron scene gleams dreadful o’er the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Armour in armour lock’d, and shields in shields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The floating plumes unnumber’d wave above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And levell’d at the skies with pointing rays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their brandish’d lances at each motion blaze.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus breathing death, in terrible array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The close compacted legions urged their way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from some mountain’s craggy forehead torn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A rock’s round fragment flies, with fury borne,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">At every shock the crackling wood resounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There stops—so Hector. Their whole force he proved,<a href="#note_230" id="noteref_230" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">230</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resistless when he raged, and, when he stopp’d, unmoved.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On him the war is bent, the darts are shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all their falchions wave around his head:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But with repeated shouts his army fires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through yon square body, and that black array:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strong as they seem, embattled like a tower;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For he that Juno’s heavenly bosom warms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first of gods, this day inspires our arms.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and roused the soul in every breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth march’d Deiphobus; but, marching, held</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his wary steps his ample shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Merion aim’d a stroke (nor aim’d it wide);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan warrior, touch’d with timely fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greek, retreating, mourn’d his frustrate blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to the ships with surly speed he went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To seek a surer javelin in his tent.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Teucer’s arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In fair Pedaeus’ verdant pastures bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youth had dwelt, remote from war’s alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And blest in bright Medesicaste’s arms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(This nymph, the fruit of Priam’s ravish’d joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Allied the warrior to the house of Troy:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Troy, when glory call’d his arms, he came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And match’d the bravest of her chiefs in fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Priam’s sons, a guardian of the throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He lived, beloved and honour’d as his own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He groans beneath the Telamonian spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As from some far-seen mountain’s airy crown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And soils its verdant tresses on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Hector’s hand a shining javelin fled:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He saw, and shunn’d the death; the forceful dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sung on, and pierced Amphimachus’s heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cteatus’ son, of Neptune’s forceful line;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain was his courage, and his race divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his broad buckler thunders on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To seize his beamy helm the victor flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And just had fastened on the dazzling prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Ajax’ manly arm a javelin flung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the shield’s round boss the weapon rung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He felt the shock, nor more was doom’d to feel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure in mail, and sheath’d in shining steel.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between the leaders of the Athenian line,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces’ prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As two grim lions bear across the lawn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Snatch’d from devouring hounds, a slaughter’d fawn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strips his bright arms; Oileus lops his head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Toss’d like a ball, and whirl’d in air away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Hector’s feet the gory visage lay.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His pensive brow the generous care express’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With which a wounded soldier touch’d his breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his sad comrades from the battle bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That office paid, he issued from his tent</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Thoas’ voice, Andraemon’s valiant son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who ruled where Calydon’s white rocks arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Pleuron’s chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Where’s now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the king: “On Greece no blame be thrown;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms are her trade, and war is all her own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis heaven, alas! and Jove’s all-powerful doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That far, far distant from our native home</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once foremost in the fight, still prone to lend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus he: and thus the god whose force can make</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solid globe’s eternal basis shake:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah! never may he see his native land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But feed the vultures on this hateful strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor dares to combat on this signal day!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Together let us battle on the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not vain the weakest, if their force unite;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ours, the bravest have confess’d in fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, he rushes where the combat burns;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And clad in arms that lighten’d all the strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or terrifies the offending world with wars;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From pole to pole the trail of glory flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus his bright armour o’er the dazzled throng</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gleam’d dreadful, as the monarch flash’d along.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, near his tent, Meriones attends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom thus he questions: “Ever best of friends!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O say, in every art of battle skill’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What holds thy courage from so brave a field?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On some important message art thou bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glows with prospects of th’ approaching day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O prince! (Meriones replies) whose care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the Cretan: “Enter, and receive</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wonted weapons; those my tent can give;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That shed a lustre round the illumined wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though I, disdainful of the distant war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enter, and see on heaps the helmets roll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We too can boast of no ignoble spoils:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But those my ship contains; whence distant far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I fight conspicuous in the van of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What need I more? If any Greek there be</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who knows not Merion, I appeal to thee.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To this, Idomeneus: “The fields of fight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have proved thy valour, and unconquer’d might:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And were some ambush for the foes design’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even there thy courage would not lag behind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In that sharp service, singled from the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fear of each, or valour, stands confess’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And looks a bloodless image of despair!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so the brave—still dauntless, still the same,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Composed his thought, determined is his eye,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fix’d his soul, to conquer or to die:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“In such assays thy blameless worth is known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every art of dangerous war thy own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those wounds were glorious all, and all before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such as may teach, ’twas still thy brave delight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">T’oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But why, like infants, cold to honour’s charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go—from my conquer’d spears the choicest take,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to their owners send them nobly back.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift at the word bold Merion snatch’d a spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, breathing slaughter, follow’d to the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Mars armipotent invades the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The wide destroyer of the race of man,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Terror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d with stern boldness, and enormous force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pride of haughty warriors to confound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Thrace they fly, call’d to the dire alarms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So march’d the leaders of the Cretan train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And their bright arms shot horror o’er the plain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then first spake Merion: “Shall we join the right,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or combat in the centre of the fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or to the left our wonted succour lend?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hazard and fame all parts alike attend.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Not in the centre (Idomen replied:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our ablest chieftains the main battle guide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each godlike Ajax makes that post his care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gallant Teucer deals destruction there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d or with shafts to gall the distant field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or bear close battle on the sounding shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hurl the blazing ruin at our head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great must he be, of more than human birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In standing fight he mates Achilles’ force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Excell’d alone in swiftness in the course.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to the left our ready arms apply,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And live with glory, or with glory die.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: and Merion to th’ appointed place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush like a fiery torrent o’er the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their force embodied in a tide they pour;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rising combat sounds along the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As warring winds, in Sirius’ sultry reign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From different quarters sweep the sandy plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken’d heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All dreadful glared the iron face of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bristled with upright spears, that flash’d afar;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And polish’d arms emblazed the flaming fields:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tremendous scene! that general horror gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But touch’d with joy the bosoms of the brave.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saturn’s great sons in fierce contention vied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And crowds of heroes in their anger died.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To crown with glory Peleus’ godlike son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Will’d not destruction to the Grecian powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Neptune, rising from his azure main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warr’d on the king of heaven with stern disdain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gods of one source, of one ethereal race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alike divine, and heaven their native place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And more than men, or gods, supremely wise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, of Jove’s superior might afraid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Neptune in human form conceal’d his aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In war and discord’s adamantine chain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is stretch’d on both, and close compell’d they die.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bold Idomeneus controls the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First by his hand Othryoneus was slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swell’d with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Call’d by the voice of war to martial fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From high Cabesus’ distant walls he came;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cassandra’s love he sought, with boasts of power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And promised conquest was the proffer’d dower.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king consented, by his vaunts abused;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king consented, but the fates refused.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field he measured with a larger stride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him as he stalk’d, the Cretan javelin found;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arms resounded as the boaster fell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And such the contract of the Phrygian king!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our offers now, illustrious prince! receive;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For such an aid what will not Argos give?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And count Atrides’ fairest daughter thine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime, on further methods to advise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There hear what Greece has on her part to say.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and dragg’d the gory corse away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Asius view’d, unable to contain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his chariot warring on the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impatient panted on his neck behind:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glitter’d, extant at the further side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then spreads a length of ruin o’er the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch’d before his much-loved coursers lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He grinds the dust distain’d with streaming gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But falls transfix’d, an unresisting prey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stately car, and labours out his breath.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus Asius’ steeds (their mighty master gone)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Remain the prize of Nestor’s youthful son.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stabb’d at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his slope shield the disappointed lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his raised arm by two strong braces stay’d,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He lay collected in defensive shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er his safe head the javelin idly sung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor’s breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warm’d in his liver, to the ground it bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief, his people’s guardian now no more!</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He once of Ilion’s youth the loveliest boy,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d as some column, or deep-rooted oak,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The riven armour sends a jarring sound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Life’s purple tide impetuous gush’d away.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Idomen, insulting o’er the slain:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">This, my third victim, to the shades I send.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approaching now thy boasted might approve,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And try the prowess of the seed of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Jove, enamour’d of a mortal dame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Minos, guardian of his country, came:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deucalion, blameless prince, was Minos’ heir;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His first-born I, the third from Jupiter:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thence my ships transport me through the main:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lord of a host, o’er all my host I shine,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To call some hero to partake the deed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forthwith Æneas rises to his thought:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For him in Troy’s remotest lines he sought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sees superior posts in meaner hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him, ambitious of so great an aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bold Deiphobus approach’d, and said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er thy bosom felt fair honour’s charms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come, and the warrior’s loved remains defend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his cares thy early youth was train’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One table fed you, and one roof contain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, and revenge it on th’ insulting foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas heard, and for a space resign’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To tender pity all his manly mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greek awaits him with collected might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the fell boar, on some rough mountain’s head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attends the tumult, and expects the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And met the Trojan with a lowering look.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youthful offspring of the god of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To these the warrior sent his voice around.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo, great Æneas rushes to the fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great dispute, of glory, or of life.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the chief. Æneas too demands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Th’ assisting forces of his native bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In order follow all th’ embodied train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like Ida’s flocks proceeding o’er the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So joys Æneas, as his native band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Moves on in rank, and stretches o’er the land.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On every side the steely circle grows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now batter’d breast-plates and hack’d helmets ring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er their heads unheeded javelins sing.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There great Idomeneus, Æneas here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And burn’d to drench the ground with mutual blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan weapon whizz’d along in air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Cretan saw, and shunn’d the brazen spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stuck deep in earth, and quiver’d where it stood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But OEnomas received the Cretan’s stroke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It ripp’d his belly with a ghastly wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And roll’d the smoking entrails on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d on the plain, he sobs away his breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor from his breast the weapon tears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though now unfit an active war to wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His listless limbs unable for the course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In standing fight he yet maintains his force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till faint with labour, and by foes repell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deiphobus beheld him as he pass’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The javelin err’d, but held its course along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gnash’d the dust, all bloody with his wound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor knew the furious father of his fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On golden clouds th’ immortal synod sate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Detain’d from bloody war by Jove and Fate.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his temples rends the glittering prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hollow helmet rings against the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his torn arm the Grecian rent away</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reeking javelin, and rejoin’d his friends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His wounded brother good Polites tends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around his waist his pious arms he threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from the rage of battle gently drew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sprinkling, as he pass’d, the sands with gore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold Aphareus by great Æneas bled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As toward the chief he turn’d his daring head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His shield reversed o’er the fallen warrior lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antilochus, as Thoon turn’d him round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hollow vein, that to the neck extends</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supine he falls, and to his social train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His time observed; for closed by foes around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His shield emboss’d the ringing storm sustains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he impervious and untouch’d remains.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Great Neptune’s care preserved from hostile rage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This youth, the joy of Nestor’s glorious age.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Faced every foe, and every danger sought;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His winged lance, resistless as the wind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obeys each motion of the master’s mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restless it flies, impatient to be free,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And meditates the distant enemy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And struck his target with the brazen spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And blunts the javelin of th’ eluded foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Splinter’d on earth flew half the broken wood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Disarm’d, he mingled in the Trojan crew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Merion’s spear o’ertook him as he flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in the belly’s rim an entrance found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While death’s strong pangs distend his labouring side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bulk enormous on the field displays;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear the conqueror from his body drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And death’s dim shadows swarm before his view.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And smote his temples with an arm so strong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The helm fell off, and roll’d amid the throng:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For dark in death the godlike owner lies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And this stood adverse with the bended bow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But harmless bounded from the plated steel.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As on some ample barn’s well harden’d floor,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The winds collected at each open door,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the broad fan with force is whirl’d around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from the steel that guards Atrides’ heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repell’d to distance flies the bounding dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp’d the bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trail’d the long lance that mark’d with blood the sand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But good Agenor gently from the wound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sling’s soft wool, snatch’d from a soldier’s side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once the tent and ligature supplied.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold! Pisander, urged by fate’s decree,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High-towering in the front, the warrior came.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lance far distant by the winds was blown.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides’ shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pisander’s spear fell shiver’d on the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so discouraged, to the future blind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like lightning brandish’d his far beaming sword.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His left arm high opposed the shining shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His right beneath, the cover’d pole-axe held;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(An olive’s cloudy grain the handle made,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This on the helm discharged a noble blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The plume dropp’d nodding to the plain below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The crashing bones before its force gave way;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fierce Atrides spurn’d him as he bled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O race perfidious, who delight in war!</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A princess raped transcends a navy storm’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In such bold feats your impious might approve,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The violated rites, the ravish’d dame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our heroes slaughter’d and our ships on flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crimes heap’d on crimes, shall bend your glory down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above the thought of man, supremely wise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From whence this favour to an impious foe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A godless crew, abandon’d and unjust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sleep’s balmy blessing, love’s endearing joy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The feast, the dance; whate’er mankind desire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bloody armour, which his train received:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sudden mix’d among the warring crew,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Never, ah, never to behold it more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against the target of the Spartan king;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus of his lance disarm’d, from death he flies,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sunk in his sad companions’ arms he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in short pantings sobb’d his soul away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While life’s red torrent gush’d from out the wound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him on his car the Paphlagonian train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In slow procession bore from off the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pensive father, father now no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And unavailing tears profusely shed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Paris from far the moving sight beheld,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With pity soften’d and with fury swell’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His honour’d host, a youth of matchless grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With his full strength he bent his angry bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wing’d the feather’d vengeance at the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For riches much, and more for virtue famed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who held his seat in Corinth’s stately town;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Polydus’ son, a seer of old renown.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oft had the father told his early doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He climb’d his vessel, prodigal of breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And chose the certain glorious path to death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And everlasting darkness shades him round.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Wrapp’d in the cloud and tumult of the field:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And conquest hovers o’er th’ Achaian bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With such a tide superior virtue sway’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But in the centre Hector fix’d remain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, on the margin of the hoary deep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And where low walls confine the beating tides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the thunder of the battle raged,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There join’d, the whole Boeotian strength remains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Locrians and Phthians, and th’ Epaean force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But join’d, repel not Hector’s fiery course.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bias and great Menestheus at their head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And brave Podarces, active in the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This drew from Phylacus his noble line;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Iphiclus’ son: and that (Oileus) thine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Young Ajax’ brother, by a stolen embrace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He dwelt far distant from his native place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By his fierce step-dame from his father’s reign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expell’d and exiled for her brother slain:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mix’d with Boeotians, on the shores of Troy.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now side by side, with like unwearied care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Ajax laboured through the field of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Join’d to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trace large furrows with the shining share;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A train of heroes followed through the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who bore by turns great Ajax’ sevenfold shield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whene’er he breathed, remissive of his might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No following troops his brave associate grace:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In close engagement an unpractised race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But skill’d from far the flying shaft to wing,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or fell the distant warrior to the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus in the van the Telamonian train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Throng’d in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy’s scattering orders open to the shower.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the gall’d Ilians to their walls retired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Address’d great Hector, and this counsel gave:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Though great in all, thou seem’st averse to lend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impartial audience to a faithful friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every art of glorious war thy own;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But in cool thought and counsel to excel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How widely differs this from warring well!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content with what the bounteous gods have given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To some the powers of bloody war belong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To some sweet music and the charm of song;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their guardians these, the nations round confess,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And towns and empires for their safety bless.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See, as thou mov’st, on dangers dangers spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And war’s whole fury burns around thy head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold! distress’d within yon hostile wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What troops, out-number’d, scarce the war maintain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Contented with the conquest of the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pay the large debt of last revolving sun;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On yonder decks, and yet o’erlooks the plains!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap’d from his chariot on the trembling ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as he leap’d his clanging arms resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And here detain the scatter’d youth of Troy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hasten back to end the doubtful day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, the towering chief prepares to go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seems a moving mountain topp’d with snow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bids anew the martial thunder rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Panthus’ son, at Hector’s high command</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But round the battlements, and round the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For many a chief he look’d, but look’d in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Asius’ son, nor Asius’ self appear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the wall some breathed their souls away.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far on the left, amid the throng he found</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opprobrious thus, th’ impatient chief reproved:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The godlike father, and th’ intrepid son?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The force of Helenus, dispensing fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Othryoneus, so fear’d of late?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black fate hang’s o’er thee from th’ avenging gods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Imperial Troy from her foundations nods;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whelm’d in thy country’s ruin shalt thou fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one devouring vengeance swallow all.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Paris thus: “My brother and my friend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In other battles I deserved thy blame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I scatter’d slaughter from my fatal bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all those heroes, two alone remain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each now disabled by a hostile spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This heart and hand shall second all thy fires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What with this arm I can, prepare to know,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ’tis not ours, with forces not our own</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To combat: strength is of the gods alone.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These words the hero’s angry mind assuage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around Polydamas, distain’d with blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Palmus, with Polypoetes the divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And two bold brothers of Hippotion’s line</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Who reach’d fair Ilion, from Ascania far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The former day; the next engaged in war).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That bears Jove’s thunder on its dreadful wings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide o’er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, gather’d, settles on the hoary deeps;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The waves behind impel the waves before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far o’er the plains, in dreadful order bright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brazen arms reflect a beamy light:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in the blazing van great Hector shined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like Mars commission’d to confound mankind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before him flaming his enormous shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like the broad sun, illumined all the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His nodding helm emits a streamy ray;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His piercing eyes through all the battle stray,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, while beneath his targe he flash’d along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot terrors round, that wither’d e’en the strong.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus stalk’d he, dreadful; death was in his look:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole nations fear’d; but not an Argive shook.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The towering Ajax, with an ample stride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not thy arm, ’tis thundering Jove we fear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The skill of war to us not idly given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your boasted city, and your god-built wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior’s fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As thus he spoke, behold, in open view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Jove’s glad omen all the Grecians rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“From whence this menace, this insulting strain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enormous boaster! doom’d to vaunt in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So may the gods on Hector life bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Not that short life which mortals lead below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But such as those of Jove’s high lineage born,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As this decisive day shall end the fame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That giant-corse, extended on the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and like a lion stalk’d along:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sent from his following host: the Grecian train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With answering thunders fill’d the echoing plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A shout that tore heaven’s concave, and, above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shook the fix’d splendours of the throne of Jove.</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is 
alarmed with the increasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on
 his way he meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs 
of the extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape 
by night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, 
that, wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army 
with their presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the 
partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: 
she sets off her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to 
enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself
 to the god of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal 
the eyes of Jupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at
 first sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is
 laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the 
Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax, 
and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the 
Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax 
signalizes himself in a particular manner.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Could charm the cares of Nestor’s watchful soul;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His startled ears the increasing cries attend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What mix’d events attend this mighty day?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when old ocean’s silent surface sleeps,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nestor’s approach alarm’d each Grecian breast,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill’d?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gerenian Nestor then: “So fate has will’d;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou the shame of any host but ours!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A host, by Jove endued with martial might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Employ’d our youth, and yet employs our age.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To think such meanness, or the thought declares?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The banded legions of all Greece obey?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is this a general’s voice that calls to flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Themselves abandon’d) shall the fight pursue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thy ships flying, with despair shall see;</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides cut him short, and thus began:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Such counsel if you seek, behold the man</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Young though he be, disdain not to obey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May speak to councils and assembled kings.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear then in me the great OEnides’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose honoured dust (his race of glory run)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies whelm’d in ruins of the Theban wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With three bold sons was generous Prothous bless’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who Pleuron’s walls and Calydon possess’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest in courage) OEneus was the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From him, my sire. From Calydon expell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He pass’d to Argos, and in exile dwell’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch’s daughter there (so Jove ordain’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He won, and flourish’d where Adrastus reign’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, rich in fortune’s gifts, his acres till’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And numerous flocks that whiten’d all the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attend, and in the son respect the sire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let each go forth, and animate the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Advance the glory which he cannot share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though not partaker, witness of the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But lest new wounds on wounds o’erpower us quite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beyond the missile javelin’s sounding flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He added not: the listening kings obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Appears a warrior furrowed o’er with age;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d in his own, the general’s hand he took,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus the venerable hero spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles sees his country’s forces fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who glories in unutterable pride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So may he perish, so may Jove disclaim</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretch relentless, and o’erwhelm with shame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Heaven forsakes not thee: o’er yonder sands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To hide their ignominious heads in Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, then rush’d amid the warrior crew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sent his voice before him as he flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such was the voice, and such the thundering sound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of him whose trident rends the solid ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime Saturnia from Olympus’ brow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joy the glorious conflict she survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But placed aloft, on Ida’s shady height</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">What arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length she trusts her power; resolved to prove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sacred to dress and beauty’s pleasing cares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With skill divine had Vulcan form’d the bower,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe from access of each intruding power.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Touch’d with her secret key, the doors unfold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here first she bathes; and round her body pours</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Part on her head in shining ringlets roll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Part o’er her shoulders waved like melted gold.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around her next a heavenly mantle flow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That rich with Pallas’ labour’d colours glow’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large clasps of gold the foldings gather’d round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A golden zone her swelling bosom bound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each gem illumined with a triple star.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then o’er her head she cast a veil more white</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed 
from the trenches, Hector in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the 
Greeks: he is highly incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him 
by her submissions; she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing
 to the assembly of the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to 
incense them against Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a 
violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but is prevented by 
Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands 
Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and 
passion, he consents. Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him 
back to the battle, marches before him with his aegis, and turns the 
fortune of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the
 Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but 
are, as yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then stopp’d and panted, where the chariots lie</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile, awaken’d from his dream of love,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Ida’s summit sat imperial Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These proud in arms, those scatter’d o’er the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, ’midst the war, the monarch of the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His senses wandering to the verge of death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god beheld him with a pitying look,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ever studious in promoting ill!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix’d on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the vast concave of the spangled sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the raging gods opposed in vain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong I hurl’d them from the Olympian hall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stunn’d in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor seem’d the vengeance worthy such a son:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shipwreck’d hero on the Coan coast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sent to Argos, and his native shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, trembling, these submissive words return’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“By every oath that powers immortal ties,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the dread honours of thy sacred head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not by my arts the ruler of the main</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By his own ardour, his own pity sway’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else had thy Juno better counsels given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And taught submission to the sire of heaven.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Think’st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The immortal father with a smile replies;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor dare to act but when we point the way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our high decree let various Iris know,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And call the god that bears the silver bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let her descend, and from the embattled plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Command the sea-god to his watery reign:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And calls his senses from the verge of death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles’ fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall fall by thousands at the hero’s feet.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, not untouch’d with pity, to the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What youths he slaughters under Ilion’s walls!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vanquish’d at last by Hector’s lance he lies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From that great hour the war’s whole fortune turns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor one of all the heavenly host engage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In aid of Greece. The promise of a god</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I gave, and seal’d it with the almighty nod,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ glory to the stars to raise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such was our word, and fate the word obeys.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trembling queen (the almighty order given)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As some wayfaring man, who wanders o’er</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In thought a length of lands he trod before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sends forth his active mind from place to place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So swift flew Juno to the bless’d abodes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If thought of man can match the speed of gods.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sat the powers in awful synod placed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They bow’d, and made obeisance as she pass’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown’d<a href="#note_239" id="noteref_239" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">239</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the white-arm’d goddess thus replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Enough thou know’st the tyrant of the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain’d his will.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bid the crown’d nectar circle round the hall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such stern decrees, such threaten’d woes to come,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And damp the eternal banquets of the skies.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The goddess said, and sullen took her place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black horror sadden’d each celestial face.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To see the gathering grudge in every breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus she proceeds—“Attend, ye powers above!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But know, ’tis madness to contest with Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce in the majesty of power controls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If that loved boasted offspring be thy own.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter’d son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Descending first to yon forbidden plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of battles dares avenge the slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dares, though the thunder bursting o’er my head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that he gives command to Fear and Flight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To join his rapid coursers for the fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From frantic Mars she snatch’d the shield and spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss’d?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Striv’st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall not the Thunderer’s dread command restrain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And was imperial Juno heard in vain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cease then thy offspring’s death unjust to call;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why should heaven’s law with foolish man comply</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exempted from the race ordain’d to die?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This menace fix’d the warrior to his throne;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sullen he sat, and curb’d the rising groan.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Juno call’d (Jove’s orders to obey)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The winged Iris, and the god of day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Go wait the Thunderer’s will (Saturnia cried)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There in the father’s awful presence stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Receive, and execute his dread command.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And various Iris, wing their airy way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the wind, to Ida’s hills they came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sat the eternal; he whose nod controls</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Veil’d in a mist of fragrance him they found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With clouds of gold and purple circled round.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Well-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And prompt obedience to the queen of air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Commands the goddess of the showery bow:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Iris! descend, and what we here ordain,</div>

</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing’d her flight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drive through the skies, when Boreas fiercely blows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from the clouds descending Iris falls,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Attend the mandate of the sire above!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In me behold the messenger of Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He bids thee from forbidden wars repair</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This if refused, he bids thee timely weigh</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His elder birthright, and superior sway.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If heaven’s omnipotence descend in arms?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Striv’st thou with him by whom all power is given?</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A noble mind disdains not to repent.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Great is the profit (thus the god rejoin’d)</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lord of thunders, from his lofty height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beheld, and thus bespoke the source of light:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Behold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Desists at length his rebel-war to wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else had my wrath, heaven’s thrones all shaking round,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the gods that round old Saturn dwell</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even power immense had found such battle hard.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shake my broad aegis on thy active arm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Greece shall breathe from toils.” The godhead said;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His will divine the son of Jove obey’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As Phoebus, shooting from the Idaean brow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Glides down the mountain to the plain below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There Hector seated by the stream he sees,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sense returning with the coming breeze;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Again his loved companions meet his eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove thinking of his pains, they pass’d away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the god who gives the golden day:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why sits great Hector from the field so far?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fainting hero, as the vision bright</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stood shining o’er him, half unseal’d his sight:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What blest immortal, with commanding breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had almost sunk me to the shades below?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hell’s black horrors swim before my eye.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him Apollo: “Be no more dismay’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breathed immortal ardour from above.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the pamper’d steed, with reins unbound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And springs, exulting, to his fields again:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the force of men and dogs combined</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from the hunter’s rage secure they lie</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When lo! a lion shoots across the way!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mark’d their progress through the ranks in blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as they see the furious chief appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thoas, the bravest of the Ætolian force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d to direct the javelin’s distant flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bold to combat in the standing fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not more in councils famed for solid sense,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What god restores him to the frighted field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And not content that half of Greece lie slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pours new destruction on her sons again?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks’ main body to the fleet command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The valiant leader of the Cretan band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind, unnumber’d multitudes attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To flank the navy, and the shores defend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector first came towering to the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High held before him, Jove’s enormous shield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From different parts, and mingle in the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These drink the life of generous warriors slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sat doubtful conquest hovering o’er the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their force is humbled, and their fear confess’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So flies a herd of oxen, scatter’d wide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When two fell lions from the mountain come,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One to the bold Boeotians ever dear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one Menestheus’ friend and famed compeer.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Medon and Iasus, Æneas sped;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But hapless Medon from Oileus came;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Ajax honour’d with a brother’s name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though born of lawless love: from home expell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A banish’d man, in Phylace he dwell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d by the vengeance of an angry wife;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy ends at last his labours and his life.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mecystes next Polydamas o’erthrew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Polites’ arm laid Echius on the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks dismay’d, confused, disperse or fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On rush’d bold Hector, gloomy as the night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbids to plunder, animates the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Points to the fleet: “For, by the gods! who flies,<a href="#note_240" id="noteref_240" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">240</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No weeping sister his cold eye shall close,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who stops to plunder at this signal hour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo, planted at the trench’s bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Push’d at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roll’d in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden road! a long and ample way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wondering crowds the downward level trod;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before them flamed the shield, and march’d the god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Easy as when ashore an infant stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And draws imagined houses in the sands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sweeps the slight works and fashion’d domes away:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus vanish’d at thy touch, the towers and walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The toil of thousands in a moment falls.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecians gaze around with wild despair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And weeps his country with a father’s eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One Greek enrich’d thy shrine with offer’d gore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er, in hope our country to behold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If e’er thou sign’st our wishes with thy nod:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perform the promise of a gracious god!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day preserve our navies from the flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And save the relics of the Grecian name.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And peals of thunder shook the firmament.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And catch’d new fury at the voice divine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above the sides of some tall ship ascend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus loudly roaring, and o’erpowering all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Legions on legions from each side arise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce on the ships above, the cars below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus the thunder of the battle raged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And labouring armies round the works engaged,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The good Eurypylus, his wounded friend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when he saw, ascending up the fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Victorious Troy; then, starting from his seat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With bitter groans his sorrows he express’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Charged with Achilles’ high command I go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mournful witness of this scene of woe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I haste to urge him by his country’s care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To rise in arms, and shine again in war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The voice is powerful of a faithful friend.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal hand he guides his whole design,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the just rule, and the directing line:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The martial leaders, with like skill and care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every ship sustained an equal tide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At one proud bark, high-towering o’er the fleet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That fix’d as fate, this acted by a god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Clytius in his daring hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, pierced by Telamon’s huge lance, expires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish’d fires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector view’d him with a sad survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As stretch’d in dust before the stern he lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Ajax shunn’d the meditated blow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It stretch’d in dust unhappy Lycophron:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An exile long, sustain’d at Ajax’ board,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A faithful servant to a foreign lord;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In peace, and war, for ever at his side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lies a lifeless load along the land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus inflames his brother to the fight:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Teucer, behold! extended on the shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our friend, our loved companion! now no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dear as a parent, with a parent’s care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To fight our wars he left his native air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This death deplored, to Hector’s rage we owe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where are those darts on which the fates attend?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impatient Teucer, hastening to his aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the chief his ample bow display’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then hiss’d his arrow, and the bowstring sung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clytus, Pisenor’s son, renown’d in fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(To thee, Polydamas! an honour’d name)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As all on glory ran his ardent mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pointed death arrests him from behind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In youth’s first bloom reluctantly he dies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hurl’d from the lofty seat, at distance far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The headlong coursers spurn his empty car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, fired to vengeance, rush’d amidst the foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rage edged his sword, and strengthen’d every blow.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more bold Teucer, in his country’s cause,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Hector’s breast a chosen arrow draws:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And had the weapon found the destined way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown’d that day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector was not doom’d to perish then:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The all-wise disposer of the fates of men</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor was such glory due to Teucer’s hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down dropp’d the bow: the shaft with brazen head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The astonish’d archer to great Ajax cries;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Some god prevents our destined enterprise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strong to impel the flight of many a dart.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall find its match—No more: ’tis ours to fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fourfold buckler o’er his shoulder tied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his brave head a crested helm he placed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Hector saw, and thus express’d his joy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spread your glory with the navy’s flame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When happy nations bear the marks divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How easy then, to see the sinking state</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And for our country, ’tis a bliss to die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gallant man, though slain in fight he be,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Entails a debt on all the grateful state;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His wife live honour’d, all his race succeed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And late posterity enjoy the deed!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The godlike Ajax next his Greeks address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How long, ye warriors of the Argive race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How long on these cursed confines will ye lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet undetermined, or to live or die?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What hopes remain, what methods to retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mark how the flames approach, how near they fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To your own hands are trusted all your fates;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And better far in one decisive strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One day should end our labour or our life,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still press’d, and press’d by such inglorious hands.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The listening Grecians feel their leader’s flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And every kindling bosom pants for fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then mutual slaughters spread on either side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chief of the foot, of old Antenor’s race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Polydamas laid Otus on the sand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fierce commander of the Epeian band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His lance bold Meges at the victor threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(That valued life, O Phoebus! was thy care)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Croesmus’ bosom took the flying spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Meges, Phyleus’ ample breastplate wore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Well-known in fight on Selle’s winding shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which oft, in cities storm’d, and battles won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had saved the father, and now saves the son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full at the Trojan’s head he urged his lance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">New ting’d with Tyrian dye: in dust below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stood by Meges’ side a sudden aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through Dolops’ shoulder urged his forceful dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which held its passage through the panting heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And issued at his breast. With thundering sound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior falls, extended on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector’s voice excites his kindred train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross’d the main)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fed his large oxen on Percote’s plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when oppress’d, his country claim’d his care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Return’d to Ilion, and excell’d in war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, in Priam’s court, he held his place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beloved no less than Priam’s royal race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’ermatch’d he falls; to two at once a prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come on—a distant war no longer wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But hand to hand thy country’s foes engage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or Ilion from her towery height descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one sad sepulchre, one common fall.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector (this said) rush’d forward on the foes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal ardour Melanippus glows:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Ajax thus—“O Greeks! respect your fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On valour’s side the odds of combat lie;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brave live glorious, or lamented die;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His generous sense he not in vain imparts;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And flank the navy with a brazen wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stop the Trojans, though impell’d by Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So strong to fight, so active to pursue?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and backward to the lines retired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth rush’d the youth with martial fury fired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round the black battalions cast his view.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the swift javelin hiss’d along in air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Advancing Melanippus met the dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his broad buckler rings against the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus on a roe the well-breath’d beagle flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The distant hunter sent into his heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observing Hector to the rescue flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when a savage, ranging o’er the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has torn the shepherd’s dog, or shepherd’s swain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While conscious of the deed, he glares around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hears the gathering multitude resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But enter’d in the Grecian ranks, he turns</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His manly breast, and with new fury burns.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire of gods, confirming Thetis’ prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecian ardour quench’d in deep despair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But lifts to glory Troy’s prevailing bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Ida’s top he waits with longing eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To view the navy blazing to the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojans fly, and conquer’d Ilion burn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These fates revolved in his almighty mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He raises Hector to the work design’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The radiant helmet on his temple burns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides’ spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet Jove deferr’d the death he was to pay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gave what fate allow’d, the honours of a day!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Burn at each foe, and single every prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He points his ardour, and exerts his might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On all sides batter’d, yet resists his power:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So some tall rock o’erhangs the hoary main,<a href="#note_241" id="noteref_241" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">241</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By winds assail’d, by billows beat in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sees the watery mountains break below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, swell’d with tempests, on the ship descends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Howl o’er the masts, and sing through every shroud:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And instant death on every wave appears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a lion, rushing from his den,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst the plain of some wide-water’d fen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At large expatiate o’er the ranker mead)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leaps on the herds before the herdsman’s eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The minister of stern Eurystheus’ ire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son redeem’d the honours of the race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A son as generous as the sire was base;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all his country’s youth conspicuous far</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In every virtue, or of peace or war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But doom’d to Hector’s stronger force to yield!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against the margin of his ample shield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His circling friends, who strove to guard too late</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now man the next, receding toward the main:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wall’d round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now fear itself confines them to the fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And by their parents, by themselves implores.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With mutual honour, and with mutual shame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your wives, your infants, and your parents share:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Think of each living father’s reverend head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Think of each ancestor with glory dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They ask their safety, and their fame, from you:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods their fates on this one action lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all are lost, if you desert the day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Minerva seconds what the sage inspires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mist of darkness Jove around them threw</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She clear’d, restoring all the war to view;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden ray shot beaming o’er the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And show’d the shores, the navy, and the main:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His port majestic, and his ample size:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fights, like others, fix’d to certain stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But looks a moving tower above the bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The godlike hero stalks from side to side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when a horseman from the watery mead</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Skill’d in the manage of the bounding steed)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To some great city through the public way;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe in his art, as side by side they run,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now to this, and now to that he flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No less the wonder of the warring crew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As furious, Hector thunder’d threats aloud,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rush’d enraged before the Trojan crowd;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lay rank’d contiguous on the bending shores;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So the strong eagle from his airy height,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who marks the swans’ or cranes’ embodied flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove leads him on with his almighty hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breathes fierce spirits in his following band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warring nations meet, the battle roars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As if new vigour from new fights they won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the long battle was but then begun.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece, yet unconquer’d, kept alive the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure of death, confiding in despair:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy in proud hopes already view’d the main</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each contends, as his were all the war.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First seized a ship on that contested strand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The same which dead Protesilaus bore,<a href="#note_242" id="noteref_242" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">242</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first that touch’d the unhappy Trojan shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this in arms the warring nations stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wounded, they wound; and seek each other’s hearts</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten’d darts.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still raging, Hector with his ample hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of 
Nestor in the eleventh book) entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to 
the assistance of the Greeks with Achilles’ troops and armour. He agrees
 to it, but at the same time charges him to content himself with 
rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of the enemy. The armour, 
horses, soldiers, and officers are described. Achilles offers a libation
 for the success of his friend, after which Patroclus leads the 
Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles’
 armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the uttermost 
consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector himself flies,
 Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate. Several 
other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of which, 
Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to the 
walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds 
him, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So warr’d both armies on the ensanguined shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the black vessels smoked with human gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not faster, trickling to the plains below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the tall rock the sable waters flow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:<a href="#note_243" id="noteref_243" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">243</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not more the mother’s soul, that infant warms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Griev’st thou for me, or for my martial band?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or come sad tidings from our native land?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our fathers live (our first, most tender care),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hoary Peleus yet extends his days;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased in their age to hear their children’s praise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Doom’d in their ships to sink by fire and sword,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er the cause, reveal thy secret care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And speak those sorrows which a friend would share.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Another follow’d, and Patroclus spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">More for their country’s wounds than for their own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May never rage like thine my soul enslave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O great in vain! unprofitably brave!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy country slighted in her last distress,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No—men unborn, and ages yet behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O man unpitying! if of man thy race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But sure thou spring’st not from a soft embrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some rugged rock’s hard entrails gave thee form,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And raging seas produced thee in a storm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“If some dire oracle thy breast alarm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If I but lead the Myrmidonian line:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without thy person Greece shall win the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thy mere image chase her foes away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Press’d by fresh forces, her o’erlabour’d train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall quit the ships, and Greece respire again.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou begg’st his arms, and in his arms thy death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unfortunately good! a boding sigh</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy friend return’d; and with it, this reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Patroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor words from Jove nor oracles he hears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor aught a mother’s caution can suggest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tyrant’s pride lies rooted in my breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I made him tyrant: gave him power to wrong</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even me: I felt it; and shall feel it long.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Due to the toils of many a well-fought day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Due to my conquest of her father’s reign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Due to the votes of all the Grecian train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Disgraced, dishonour’d, like the meanest slave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But bear we this—the wrongs I grieve are past;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis time our fury should relent at last:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I fix’d its date; the day I wish’d appears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How Hector to my ships his battle bears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour’s charms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Troy’s famed fields, and in Achilles’ arms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See the thin relics of their baffled band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At the last edge of yon deserted land!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold all Ilion on their ships descends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had not the injurious king our friendship lost,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yon ample trench had buried half her host.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No longer flames the lance of Tydeus’ son;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more your general calls his heroes on:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heed my words, and mark a friend’s command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rage uncontroll’d through all the hostile crew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though Jove in thunder should command the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor lead to Ilion’s walls the Grecian race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Greece, redeem’d from this destructive strait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O! would to all the immortal powers above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That not one Trojan might be left alive,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And not a Greek of all the race survive:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Might only we the vast destruction shun,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And only we destroy the accursed town!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove with conquest crown’d the Trojan band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So thick the darts an iron tempest rain’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And painful sweat from all his members flows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spent and o’erpower’d, he barely breathes at most;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dangers on dangers all around him glow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame?</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That the broad falchion lopp’d its brazen head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Ajax saw, and own’d the hand divine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warn’d he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the high stern the curling volumes rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine Achilles view’d the rising flames,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm, ere the Grecians be no more a name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I haste to bring the troops.”—The hero said;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The friend with ardour and with joy obey’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He cased his limbs in brass; and first around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His manly legs, with silver buckles bound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The clasping greaves; then to his breast applies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the rich belt, as in a starry zone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ shield his ample shoulders spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ helmet nodded o’er his head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Adorn’d in all his terrible array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He flash’d around intolerable day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alone untouch’d, Pelides’ javelin stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not to be poised but by Pelides’ hands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Pelion’s shady brow the plant entire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose son’s great arm alone the weapon wields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Troy repulsed, and scatter’d o’er the plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As Areilycus had turn’d him round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thigh transfix’d, and broke the brittle bone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy breast, unarm’d, received the Spartan lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phylides’ dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother’s wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arm falls spouting on the dust below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sinks, with endless darkness cover’d o’er:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sarpedon’s friends, Amisodarus’ seed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bane of men, abhorr’d Chimaera bred;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d in the dart in vain, his sons expire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stopp’d in the tumult Cleobulus lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath Oileus’ arm, a living prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A living prize not long the Trojan stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain their javelins at each other flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The daring Lycon aim’d a noble blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the juncture of the neck and head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The head, divided by a stroke so just,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next Erymas was doom’d his fate to feel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His open’d mouth received the Cretan steel:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crash’d the thin bones, and drown’d the teeth in gore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the flocks neglected by the swain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter’d o’er the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dark o’er the fields the ascending vapour flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from the ships, along the dusky plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fiery coursers forced their lord away:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While far behind his Trojans fall confused;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain they labour up the steepy mound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch’d from sight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scour o’er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud o’er the rout was heard the victor’s cry,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where horse and arms, and chariots lie o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bleeding heroes under axles groan.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High-bounding o’er the fosse, the whirling car</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smokes through the ranks, o’ertakes the flying war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And earth is loaden with incessant showers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole fields are drown’d, and mountains swept away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling man sees all his labours vain!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the chief (the foremost troops repell’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back to the ships his destined progress held,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between the space where silver Simois flows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fell the victim of his coward fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus mark’d him as he shunn’d the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dropp’d the flowing reins. Him ’twixt the jaws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As on a rock that overhangs the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An angler, studious of the line and cane,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And death involved him with the shades of hell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where’er he moves, the growing slaughters spread</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With this reproach his flying host he warms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This hand unaided shall the war sustain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The task be mine this hero’s strength to try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when two vultures on the mountain’s height</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal clamours, and with equal rage.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove view’d the combat: whose event foreseen,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,<a href="#note_245" id="noteref_245" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">245</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already on the verge of death he stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His life is owed to fierce Patroclus’ hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What passions in a parent’s breast debate!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And send him safe to Lycia, distant far</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From all the dangers and the toils of war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose bounds were fix’d before his race began?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How many sons of gods, foredoom’d to death,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And when the ascending soul has wing’d her flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The breathless body to his native land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friends and people, to his future praise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lasting honours to his ashes give;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fame (’tis all the dead can have) shall live.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then touch’d with grief, the weeping heavens distill’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A shower of blood o’er all the fatal field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god, his eyes averting from the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laments his son, predestined to be slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now met in arms, the combatants appear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From strong Patroclus’ hand the javelin fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pass’d the groin of valiant Thrasymed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first aloof with erring fury flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The next transpierced Achilles’ mortal steed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d in the shoulder’s joint, he reel’d around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roll’d in the bloody dust, and paw’d the slippery ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When bold Automedon, to disengage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divides the traces with his sword, and freed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest move on, obedient to the rein:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The car rolls slowly o’er the dusty plain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first Sarpedon whirl’d his weighty lance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spent in empty air its dying force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so Patroclus’ never-erring dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Aim’d at his breast it pierced a mortal part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his chariot stretch’d his form divine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He grasp’d the dust distain’d with streaming gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So lies a bull beneath the lion’s paws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to the leader of the Lycian band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dying chief address’d his last command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glorious dangers of destructive war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To lead my troops, to combat at their head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Incite the living, and supply the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon’s death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If these spoil’d arms adorn a Grecian foe!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defend my body, conquer in my right:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That, taught by great examples, all may try</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He ceased; the Fates suppress’d his labouring breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his eyes darken’d with the shades of death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The insulting victor with disdain bestrode</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the wide wound gush’d out a stream of blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the soul issued in the purple flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unguided now, their mighty master slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All-impotent of aid, transfix’d with grief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His painful arm, yet useless with the smart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inflicted late by Teucer’s deadly dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supported on his better hand he stay’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Phoebus then (’twas all he could) he pray’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia’s coast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Powerful alike to ease the wretch’s smart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O hear me! god of every healing art!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I stand unable to sustain the spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard the relics of my slaughter’d friend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To head my Lycians, and support the fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His heavenly hand restrain’d the flux of blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He drew the dolours from the wounded part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Renew’d by art divine, the hero stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And owns the assistance of immortal hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First to the fight his native troops he warms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then loudly calls on Troy’s vindictive arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With ample strides he stalks from place to place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas next, and Hector he accosts;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those generous friends, who, from their country far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breathe their brave souls out in another’s war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In action valiant, and in council wise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who guarded right, and kept his people free;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d by Patroclus’ arm on yonder plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O save from hostile rage his loved remains!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah let not Greece his conquer’d trophies boast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Transfix’d with deep regret, they view o’erthrown</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once his country’s pillar, and their own;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A chief, who led to Troy’s beleaguer’d wall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A host of heroes, and outshined them all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with superior vengeance greatly glows.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But o’er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Heroes, be men; be what you were before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or weigh the great occasion, and be more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies pale in death, extended on the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And send the living Lycians to the dead.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heroes kindle at his fierce command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The martial squadrons close on either hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The clash of armour rings o’er all the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round his son confounds the warring hosts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Agacleus’ son, from Budium’s lofty walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now sent to Troy, Achilles’ arms to aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He pays due vengeance to his kinsman’s shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as his luckless hand had touch’d the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A rock’s large fragment thunder’d on his head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hurl’d by Hectorean force it cleft in twain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His shatter’d helm, and stretch’d him o’er the slain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, like an eagle darting at his game,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That arm, drew back; and Hector learn’d to fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far as an able hand a lance can throw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So far the Trojans from their lines retired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The only hope of Chalcon’s trembling age;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide o’er the land was stretch’d his large domain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fell, and falling made the fields resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An iron circle round the carcase grows.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then brave Laogonus resign’d his breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Despatch’d by Merion to the shades of death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Ida’s holy hill he made abode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The priest of Jove, and honour’d like his god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His spear Æneas at the victor threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lance hiss’d harmless o’er his covering shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sent by the great Æneas’ arm in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And skill’d in dancing to dispute the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My spear, the destined passage had it found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had fix’d thy active vigour to the ground.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O valiant leader of the Dardan host!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strong as you are, ’tis mortal force you trust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And if to this my lance thy fate be given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This, instant, sends thee down to Pluto’s coast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O friend (Menoetius’ son this answer gave)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With words to combat, ill befits the brave;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To speak, beseems the council; but to dare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In glorious action, is the task of war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, Patroclus to the battle flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Merion follows, and new shouts arise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The labours of the woodman’s axe resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While crackling forests fall on every side:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies undistinguish’d from the vulgar dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On every side the busy combat grows;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick as beneath some shepherd’s thatch’d abode</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The buzzing flies, a persevering train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Incessant swarm, and chased return again.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove view’d the combat with a stern survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And eyes that flash’d intolerable day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d on the field his sight, his breast debates</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vengeance due, and meditates the fates:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The force of Hector to Patroclus’ fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This instant see his short-lived trophies won,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch him breathless on his slaughter’d son;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or yet, with many a soul’s untimely flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Augment the fame and horror of the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To crown Achilles’ valiant friend with praise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length he dooms; and, that his last of days</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor unattended see the shades below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Hector’s mind he fills with dire dismay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sunk with Troy’s heavy fates, he sees decline</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left their monarch with the common dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prize contested, and despoil the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus’ ships the glorious spoils adorn.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus to Phoebus, in the realms above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Descend, my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then bathe his body in the crystal flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With dust dishonour’d, and deform’d with blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with celestial robes adorn the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What honour mortals after death receive,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to the field precipitates his flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Veil’d in a cloud, to silver Simois’ shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His manly members in the immortal vest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restores his freshness, and his form renews.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Received Sarpedon, at the god’s command,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With foaming coursers, and with loosen’d reins.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain was thy friend’s command, thy courage vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who last beneath thy vengeance press’d the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When heaven itself thy fatal fury led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And call’d to fill the number of the dead?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Troy had stoop’d beneath his matchless power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;<a href="#note_246" id="noteref_246" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">246</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles’ hand.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His panting coursers, in his breast debates,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or in the field his forces to employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Asius’ shape, who reigned by Sangar’s flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus he accosts him. “What a shameful sight!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Were thine my vigour this successful spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in Patroclus’ blood efface thy shame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god the Grecians’ sinking souls depress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pour’d swift spirits through each Trojan breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A spear his left, a stone employs his right:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his fatal courage finds his bane.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once bold Hector leaping from his car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defends the body, and provokes the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus for some slaughter’d hind, with equal rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Hector fastens on the warrior’s head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the whole forest in one crash descends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Darts shower’d on darts, now round the carcase ring;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, stretch’d in death, forgets the guiding reins!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While on each host with equal tempests fell</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when his evening wheels o’erhung the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They draw the conquer’d corse and radiant arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The last, black remnant of so bright a line:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn’d senses reel</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ plume is stain’d with dust and gore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That plume which never stoop’d to earth before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long used, untouch’d, in fighting fields to shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shade the temples of the mad divine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove dooms it now on Hector’s helm to nod;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The corslet his astonish’d breast forsakes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is the force of more than mortal hands!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d in the dart, and matchless in the course:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While yet he learn’d his rudiments of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His venturous spear first drew the hero’s gore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor, though disarm’d, Patroclus’ fury stood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turn’d him short, and herded in the crowd.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Retires for succour to his social train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her yet-surviving heroes seem’d to fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So, scorch’d with heat, along the desert score,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear’d with blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So many lives effused, expires his own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As dying now at Hector’s feet he lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though much at parting that great chief might say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And much enjoin thee, this important day.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">‘Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, Patroclus march’d, and thus he sped.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove’s and Apollo’s is this deed, not thine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To heaven is owed whate’er your own you call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven itself disarm’d me ere my fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By fate and Phoebus was I first o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black fate o’erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even now on life’s last verge I see thee stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I see thee fall, and by Achilles’ hand.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The beauteous body left a load of clay)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the pale carcase, thus address’d the dead:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“From whence this boding speech, the stern decree</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why not as well Achilles’ fate be given</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Hector’s lance? Who knows the will of heaven?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But swift Automedon with loosen’d reins</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rapt in the chariot o’er the distant plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.—THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends 
his body from the enemy: Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector 
advancing, Menelaus retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him 
off. This, Glaucus objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on 
the armour he had won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks 
give way, till Ajax rallies them: Æneas sustains the Trojans. Æneas and 
Hector attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon.
 The horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers 
his body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that 
occasion. Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of 
Patroclus’ death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with
 the utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the 
body to the ships.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in the fields before Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Menelaus, touch’d with generous woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother’s care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opposed to each that near the carcase came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Panthus, skill’d the dart to send,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Depart with life, and leave the glory mine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With generous anguish, and in scorn return’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Laugh’st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When mortals boast of prowess not their own?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus the lion glories in his might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But far the vainest of the boastful kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet ’twas but late, beneath my conquering steel</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This boaster’s brother, Hyperenor, fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against our arm which rashly he defied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: “That action known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come, for my brother’s blood repay thy own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His weeping father claims thy destined head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On these thy conquer’d spoils I shall bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To soothe a consort’s and a parent’s woe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No longer then defer the glorious strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-aim’d weapon on the buckler rings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Jove the father great Atrides calls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining circlets of his golden hair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Instarr’d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With dust dishonour’d, and deform’d with gore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crown’d by fresh fountains with eternal green,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And plays and dances to the gentle air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tender plant, and withers all its shades;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It lies uprooted from its genial bed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flies, as before some mountain lion’s ire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The village curs and trembling swains retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When o’er the slaughter’d bull they hear him roar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And see his jaws distil with smoking gore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All pale with fear, at distance scatter’d round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They shout incessant, and the vales resound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile Apollo view’d with envious eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(In Mentes’ shape, beneath whose martial care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rough Ciconians learn’d the trade of war;)<a href="#note_247" id="noteref_247" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">247</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ coursers, of ethereal race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They stoop not, these, to mortal man’s command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or stoop to none but great Achilles’ hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fire which burn’d in that undaunted breast!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having spoke, Apollo wing’d his flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mix’d with mortals in the toils of fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His words infix’d unutterable care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in great Hector’s soul: through all the war</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The breathless hero in his blood imbued,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in the victor’s hands the shining prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sheath’d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It flew, and fired the nations as it went.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides from the voice the storm divined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus explored his own unconquer’d mind:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To brave the hero were to brave the god:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And give Achilles all that yet remains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of his and our Patroclus—” This, no more</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The time allow’d: Troy thicken’d on the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With heart indignant and retorted eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now enter’d in the Spartan ranks, he turn’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His manly breast, and with new fury burn’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all the black battalions sent his view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All grim in arms, and cover’d o’er with blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There breathing courage, where the god of day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the king: “Oh Ajax, oh my friend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste, and Patroclus’ loved remains defend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The body to Achilles to restore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Demands our care; alas, we can no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector glories in the dazzling prize.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and touch’d his heart. The raging pair</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already had stern Hector seized his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And doom’d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But soon as Ajax rear’d his tower-like shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To stand a trophy of his fame in war.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now before, and now behind he stood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With many a step, the lioness surrounds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dark o’er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A manly form, without a manly mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is this, O chief! a hero’s boasted fame?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How vain, without the merit, is the name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What other methods may preserve thy Troy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis time to try if Ilion’s state can stand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What from thy thankless arms can we expect?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Say, shall our slaughter’d bodies guard your walls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While unreveng’d the great Sarpedon falls?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On my command if any Lycian wait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Did such a spirit as the gods impart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Such as should burn in every soul that draws</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sword for glory, and his country’s cause)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sarpedon’s arms and honour’d corse again!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece with Achilles’ friend should be repaid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus due honours purchased to his shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But words are vain—Let Ajax once appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou dar’st not meet the terrors of his eye;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lo! already thou prepar’st to fly.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Trojan chief with fix’d resentment eyed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector’s ear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From such a warrior such a speech should hear?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I deem’d thee once the wisest of thy kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove’s high will is ever uncontroll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strikes the fresh garland from the victor’s brow!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or yet their hero dare defend the dead.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be men, my friends, in action as in name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector in proud Achilles’ arms shall shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He strode along the field, as thus he said:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The sable plumage nodded o’er his head:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One instant saw, one instant overtook</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The distant band, that on the sandy shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His train to Troy convey’d the massy load.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The work and present of celestial hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By aged Peleus to Achilles given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His father’s arms not long Achilles wears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbid by fate to reach his father’s years.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god whose thunder rends the troubled air</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, conscious, look’d through all the scene of fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He shook the sacred honours of his head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A moment’s glory; and what fates attend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In heavenly panoply divinely bright</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou stand’st, and armies tremble at thy sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As at Achilles’ self! beneath thy dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies slain the great Achilles’ dearer part.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A blaze of glory ere thou fad’st away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ah! no more Andromache shall come</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more officious, with endearing charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides’ arms!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with his sable brow he gave the nod</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That seals his word; the sanction of the god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stubborn arms (by Jove’s command disposed)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Conform’d spontaneous, and around him closed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fill’d with the god, enlarged his members grew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The blood in brisker tides began to roll,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And look’d, and moved, Achilles, or a god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Thersilochus like fury found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Ennomus, in augury renown’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber’d bands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas not for state we summon’d you so far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To save our present, and our future race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To die or conquer are the terms of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whoe’er shall drag him to the Trojan train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Hector’s self shall equal honours claim;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o’erspread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What victims perish round the mighty dead!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Ajax mark’d the growing storm from far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus bespoke his brother of the war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all our wars and glories at an end!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Condemn’d to vultures on the Trojan plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior raised his voice, and wide around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field re-echoed the distressful sound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oilean Ajax first the voice obey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Merion, burning with a hero’s rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The long-succeeding numbers who can name?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole Troy embodied rush’d with shouts along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in the mouth is stopp’d the rushing tide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The boiling ocean works from side to side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The river trembles to his utmost shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove, pouring darkness o’er the mingled fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Conceals the warriors’ shining helms in night:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dead he protects him with superior care.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas through the form assumed descries</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The power conceal’d, and thus to Hector cries:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bold example all his hosts pursue.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who view’d his fall, and, grieving at the chance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The whirling lance, with vigorous force address’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Descends, and pants in Apisaon’s breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From rich Paeonia’s vales the warrior came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rush’d to combat, but he rush’d in vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Indissolubly firm, around the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hemm’d with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in an orb contracts the crowded war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stands the centre and the soul of all:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece, in close order, and collected might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seem’d as extinct: day ravish’d from their eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all heaven’s splendours blotted from the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such o’er Patroclus’ body hung the night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No vapour rested on the mountain’s head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The golden sun pour’d forth a stronger ray,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the broad expansion flamed with day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And here and there their scatter’d arrows light:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But death and darkness o’er the carcase spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There burn’d the war, and there the mighty bled.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor knew the fortune of Achilles’ friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In thought they view’d him still, with martial joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thick and heavy grows the work of death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erlabour’d now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o’er;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a slaughter’d bull’s yet reeking hide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strain’d with full force, and tugg’d from side to side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o’er</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So tugging round the corse both armies stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not Pallas’ self, her breast when fury warms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles in his ships at distance lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, yet unconscious of Patroclus’ fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dust extended under Ilion’s wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And for his wish’d return prepares in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest, in pity to her son, conceal’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dares desert this well-disputed day!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First may the cleaving earth before our eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shake the brazen concave of the skies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their godlike master slain before their eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They wept, and shared in human miseries.<a href="#note_248" id="noteref_248" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">248</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain Automedon now shakes the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On some good man or woman unreproved</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lays its eternal weight; or fix’d, as stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A marble courser by the sculptor’s hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Placed on the hero’s grave. Along their face</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trail’d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And prone to earth was hung their languid head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Jove disdain’d to cast a pitying look,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Did we your race on mortal man bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ah! what is there of inferior birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What wretched creature of what wretched kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A miserable race! but cease to mourn:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For not by you shall Priam’s son be borne</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the splendid car: one glorious prize</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Automedon your rapid flight shall bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe to the navy through the storm of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For yet ’tis given to Troy to ravage o’er</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With sacred darkness shades the face of all.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and breathing in the immortal horse</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The kindling chariot through the parted war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So flies a vulture through the clamorous train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now to conquest with like speed pursue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach’d the chariot, and the chief address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ arms triumphant in the fields.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“In happy time (the charioteer replies)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or holds their fury in suspended reins:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now Patroclus is an empty name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And call’d Æneas fighting near his side.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ car, deserted of its lord!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glorious steeds our ready arms invite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Can such opponents stand when we assail?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Venus to the counsel yields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then o’er their backs they spread their solid shields:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain advance! not fated to return.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmov’d, Automedon attends the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For hard the fight, determined is the foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With great Atrides. “Hither turn, (he said,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn where distress demands immediate aid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And save the living from a fiercer foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhelp’d we stand, unequal to engage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The force of Hector, and Æneas’ rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which pass’d the shield of Aretus the young:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It pierced his belt, emboss’d with curious art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then in the lower belly struck the dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a ponderous axe, descending full,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:<a href="#note_249" id="noteref_249" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">249</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck ’twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now at Automedon the Trojan foe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stooping, he shunn’d; the javelin idly fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hiss’d innoxious o’er the hero’s head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In long vibrations spent its fury there.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But left their slain companion in his blood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arms Automedon divests, and cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So looks the lion o’er a mangled boar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er his seat the bloody trophies hung.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now Minerva from the realms of air</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Descends impetuous, and renews the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when high Jove denouncing future woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or from the rage of man, destructive war,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his half-till’d field the labourer flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In such a form the goddess round her drew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assuming Phoenix’ shape on earth she falls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And lies Achilles’ friend, beloved by all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What shame ’o Greece for future times to tell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O chief, O father! (Atreus’ son replies)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O full of days! by long experience wise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What more desires my soul, than here unmoved</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard the body of the man I loved?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah, would Minerva send me strength to rear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Jove’s own glories blaze around his head!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased to be first of all the powers address’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She breathes new vigour in her hero’s breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o’er),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sent his soul with every lance he threw.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Aetion’s son, and Podes was his name:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With riches honour’d, and with courage bless’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through his broad belt the spear a passage found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sudden at Hector’s side Apollo stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like Phaenops, Asius’ son, appear’d the god;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A chief once thought no terror of the field?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He bears victorious, while our army flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This heard, o’er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That shaded Ide and all the subject field</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Involved the mount; the thunder roar’d aloud;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At one regard of his all-seeing eye</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vanquish’d triumph, and the victors fly.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For as the brave Boeotian turn’d his head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And razed his shoulder with a shorten’d spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As Hector follow’d, Idomen address’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flaming javelin to his manly breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brittle point before his corslet yields;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on his chariots the Cretan stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Priam whirl’d the massive wood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with his life his master’s safety bought.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The teeth it shatter’d, and the tongue it rent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His dying hand forgets the falling rein:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Merion reaches, bending from the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And urges to desert the hopeless war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the swift chariot to the navy flies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And conquest shifting to the Trojan side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn’d by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Atreus’s seed, the godlike Telamon:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Alas! who sees not Jove’s almighty hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Transfers the glory to the Trojan band?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He suffers every lance to fall in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deserted of the god, yet let us try</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What human strength and prudence can supply;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet this honour’d corse, in triumph borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May glad the fleets that hope not our return,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some hero too must be despatch’d to bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mournful message to Pelides’ ear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For sure he knows not, distant on the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But such a chief I spy not through the host:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In general darkness—Lord of earth and air!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let us perish in the face of day!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god relenting clear’d the clouded air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The blaze of armour flash’d against the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet Antilochus survives the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let him to great Achilles’ ear convey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fatal news”—Atrides hastes away.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So turns the lion from the nightly fold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long gall’d by herdsmen, and long vex’d by hounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the red terrors of the blazing brands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So moved Atrides from his dangerous place</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foe, he fear’d, might yet Patroclus gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And much admonish’d, much adjured his train:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O guard these relics to your charge consign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bear the merits of the dead in mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How skill’d he was in each obliging art;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He was, alas! but fate decreed his end,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In death a hero, as in life a friend!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round on all sides sent his piercing view.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all that wings the mid aërial sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred eagle, from his walks above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not with less quickness, his exerted sight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pass’d this and that way, through the ranks of fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the king: “Beloved of Jove! draw near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For sadder tidings never touch’d thy ear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy eyes have witness’d what a fatal turn!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He too may haste the naked corse to gain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The arms are Hector’s, who despoil’d the slain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then ran the mournful message to impart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Though sore distress’d) to aid the Pylian bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But hope not, warriors, for Achilles’ aid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unarm’d, he fights not with the Trojan foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Merion’s aid, the weighty corse to rear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Myself, and my bold brother will sustain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shock of Hector and his charging train:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What Troy can dare, we have already tried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have tried it, and have stood.” The hero said.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A general clamour rises at the sight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Voracious hounds, that many a length before</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if the savage turns his glaring eye,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All pale they tremble and forsake the field.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus aloft the hero’s corse they bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind them rages all the storm of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confusion, tumult, horror, o’er the throng</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whelm some city under waves of fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heroes sweat beneath their honour’d load:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when two mules, along the rugged road,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the steep mountain with exerted strength</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drag some vast beam, or mast’s unwieldy length;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So these—Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus when a river swell’d with sudden rains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spreads his broad waters o’er the level plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some interposing hill the stream divides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still close they follow, close the rear engage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Within, without the trench, and all the way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strow’d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such horror Jove impress’d! yet still proceeds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The news of the death of Patroclus is brought 
to Achilles by Antilochus. Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with 
all her sea- nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son 
on this occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and 
orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight 
of him turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is 
carried off by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and 
Polydamas disagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former 
prevails, to remain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over 
the body of Patroclus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain 
new arms for her son. The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: 
and, lastly, that noble one of the shield of Achilles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, 
and the night ensuing, take up this book: the scene is at Achilles’ tent
 on the sea-shore, from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,<a href="#note_250" id="noteref_250" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">250</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile, where Hellespont’s broad waters flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stood Nestor’s son, the messenger of woe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On hoisted yards extended to the gales;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pensive he sat; for all that fate design’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to his soul he said: “Ah! what constrains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is this the day, which heaven so long ago</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ordain’d, to sink me with the weight of woe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(So Thetis warn’d;) when by a Trojan hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bravest of the Myrmidonian band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And warn’d to shun Hectorean force in vain!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tells the melancholy tale with tears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His naked corse: his arms are Hector’s right.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden horror shot through all the chief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wrapp’d his senses in the cloud of grief;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scorching ashes o’er his graceful head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His purple garments, and his golden hairs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And roll’d and grovell’d, as to earth he grew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The virgin captives, with disorder’d charms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Won by his own, or by Patroclus’ arms,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush’d from their tents with cries; and gathering round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Nestor’s son sustains a manlier part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mourns the warrior with a warrior’s heart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And oft prevents the meditated blow.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far in the deep abysses of the main,<a href="#note_251" id="noteref_251" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">251</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hoary Nereus, and the watery train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mother-goddess from her crystal throne</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heard his loud cries, and answer’d groan for groan.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The circling Nereids with their mistress weep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the sea-green sisters of the deep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thalia, Glauce (every watery name),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the blue languish of soft Alia’s eye.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Thetis’ sorrows thus began to flow:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How just a cause has Thetis to complain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How more than wretched in the immortal state!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bravest far that ever bore the name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like some fair olive, by my careful hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He grew, he flourish’d and adorn’d the land</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He never, never must return again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So short a space the light of heaven to view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So short, alas! and fill’d with anguish too!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I go at least to bear a tender part,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mourn my loved-one with a mother’s heart.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She said, and left the caverns of the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All bathed in tears; the melancholy train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the long pomp the silver wave divides.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approaching now, they touch’d the Trojan land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, two by two, ascended up the strand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal mother, standing close beside</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along the coast their mingled clamours ran,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus the silver-footed dame began:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why mourns my son? thy late preferr’d request</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god has granted, and the Greeks distress’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Reveal the cause, and trust a parent’s care.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, deeply groaning—“To this cureless grief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not even the Thunderer’s favour brings relief.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cursed be that day, when all the powers above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O hadst thou still, a sister of the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mortal beauty to his equal bed!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let me revenge it on proud Hector’s heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On these conditions will I breathe: till then,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I blush to walk among the race of men.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Hector falls, thou diest.”—“Let Hector die,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He fell, and falling, wish’d my aid in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah then, since from this miserable day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I cast all hope of my return away;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fate of Hector from Achilles’ hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since here, for brutal courage far renown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I live an idle burden to the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Others in council famed for nobler skill,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">More useful to preserve, than I to kill,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let me—But oh! ye gracious powers above!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis past—I quell it; I resign to fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Alcides, Jove’s unequall’d son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Juno’s hate, at length resign’d his breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shall Achilles fall! stretch’d pale and dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And reap what glory life’s short harvest yields.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall I not force some widow’d dame to tear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With frantic hands her long dishevell’d hair?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“My son (coerulean Thetis made reply,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then turning to the daughters of the main,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles thus. And Iris thus replies:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“I come, Pelides! from the queen of Jove,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unknown to all the synod of the sky.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm’d);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms I have none, and can I fight unarm’d?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unwilling as I am, of force I stay,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">That, in my friend’s defence, has Ajax spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While his strong lance around him heaps the dead:</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But though unarm’d, yet clad in terrors, go!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let but Achilles o’er yon trench appear,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She spoke, and pass’d in air. The hero rose:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her aegis Pallas o’er his shoulder throws;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around his brows a golden cloud she spread;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A stream of glory flamed above his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when from some beleaguer’d town arise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The smokes, high curling to the shaded skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Seen from some island, o’er the main afar,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth march’d the chief, and distant from the crowd,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the rampart raised his voice aloud;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With her own shout Minerva swells the sound;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">So high his brazen voice the hero rear’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hosts dropp’d their arms, and trembled as they heard:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Aghast they see the living lightnings play,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On their own spears, by their own chariots crush’d:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Glow’d with refulgent arms, and horrid war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two mighty hosts a leaguer’d town embrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And one would pillage, one would burn the place.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime the townsmen, arm’d with silent care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A secret ambush on the foe prepare:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their wives, their children, and the watchful band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gold their armour: these the squadron led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">August, divine, superior by the head!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cover’d with shields, beside a silver flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon the white flocks proceeded o’er the plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind them piping on their reeds they go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In arms the glittering squadron rising round</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The waving silver seem’d to blush with blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There Tumult, there Contention stood confess’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One rear’d a dagger at a captive’s breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One held a living foe, that freshly bled</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With new-made wounds; another dragg’d a dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now here, now there, the carcases they tore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fate stalk’d amidst them, grim with human gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the whole war came out, and met the eye;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And each bold figure seem’d to live or die.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A field deep furrow’d next the god design’d,<a href="#note_256" id="noteref_256" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">256</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still as at either end they wheel around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The master meets them with his goblet crown’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll’d;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Another field rose high with waving grain;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sheaves heap’d on sheaves here thicken up the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gatherers follow, and collect in bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And last the children, in whose arms are borne</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rustic monarch of the field descries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With silent glee, the heaps around him rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A ready banquet on the turf is laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath an ample oak’s expanded shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reaper’s due repast, the woman’s care.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A deeper dye the dangling clusters show,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And curl’d on silver props, in order glow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A darker metal mix’d intrench’d the place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To this, one pathway gently winding leads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where march a train with baskets on their heads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The purple product of the autumnal year.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In measured dance behind him move the train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A rapid torrent through the rushes roars:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two lions rushing from the wood appear’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seized a bull, the master of the herd:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He roar’d: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gazing multitudes admire around:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two active tumblers in the centre bound;</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK XIX.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Thetis brings to her son the armour made by 
Vulcan. She preserves the body of his friend from corruption, and 
commands him to assemble the army, to declare his resentment at an end. 
Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, 
and ceremonies on that occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty 
persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed 
themselves by the advice of Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the 
tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The 
hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives himself up to 
lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the 
order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight: his appearance described. He 
addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with the death of 
Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired 
to prophesy his fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, 
rushes with fury to the combat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The thirtieth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above the waves, that blush’d with early red,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d o’er Patroclus’ corse; while all the rest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their sovereign’s sorrows in their own express’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And flash incessant like a stream of fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On all the immortal artist had design’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With matchless art, confess the hand divine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now to the bloody battle let me bend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ah! the relics of my slaughter’d friend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“That unavailing care be laid aside,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The azure goddess to her son replied,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole years untouch’d, uninjured shall remain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But go, Achilles, as affairs require,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then uncontroll’d in boundless war engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!”</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Untouch’d it rests, and sacred from decay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles to the strand obedient went:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shores resounded with the voice he sent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The heroes heard, and all the naval train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That tend the ships, or guide them o’er the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alarm’d, transported, at the well-known sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Frequent and full, the great assembly crown’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Studious to see the terror of the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long lost to battle, shine in arms again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tydides and Ulysses first appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These on the sacred seats of council placed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of men, Atrides, came the last:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He too sore wounded by Agenor’s son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles (rising in the midst) begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O monarch! better far had been the fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If (ere the day when by mad passion sway’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rash we contended for the black-eyed maid)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Preventing Dian had despatch’d her dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shot the shining mischief to the heart!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then many a hero had not press’d the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Troy’s glad fields been fatten’d with our gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sad posterity repeat the tale.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But this, no more the subject of debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is past, forgotten, and resign’d to fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Burn with a fury that can never die?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here then my anger ends: let war succeed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall ’scape with transport, and with joy repose.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: his finish’d wrath with loud acclaim</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks accept, and shout Pelides’ name.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When thus, not rising from his lofty throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In state unmoved, the king of men begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hear me, ye sons of Greece! with silence hear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And grant your monarch an impartial ear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let your rash, injurious clamours end:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Know, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When from Achilles’ arms I forced the prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What then could I against the will of heaven?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not by myself, but vengeful Ate driven;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She, Jove’s dread daughter, fated to infest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The race of mortals, enter’d in my breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not on the ground that haughty fury treads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But prints her lofty footsteps on the heads</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of mighty men; inflicting as she goes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of old, she stalk’d amid the bright abodes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Jove himself, the sire of men and gods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The world’s great ruler, felt her venom’d dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deceived by Juno’s wiles, and female art:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For when Alcmena’s nine long months were run,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Jove expected his immortal son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To gods and goddesses the unruly joy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He show’d, and vaunted of his matchless boy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">‘From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saturnia ask’d an oath, to vouch the truth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fix dominion on the favour’d youth.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The joyful goddess, from Olympus’ height,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus’s wife;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She push’d her lingering infant into life:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her charms Alcmena’s coming labours stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stop the babe, just issuing to the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">‘A youth (said she) of Jove’s immortal kind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And claims thy promise to be king of kings.’</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung to the soul, he sorrow’d, and he raged.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his ambrosial head, where perch’d she sate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He snatch’d the fury-goddess of debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal seats should ne’er behold her more;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whirl’d her headlong down, for ever driven</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From bright Olympus and the starry heaven:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence on the nether world the fury fell;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While raging Hector heap’d our camps with dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What can the errors of my rage atone?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My martial troops, my treasures are thy own:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er Ulysses promised at thy tent:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Peleus thus; and thus replies</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long and laborious must the combat be,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When by the gods inspired, and led by thee.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strength is derived from spirits and from blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And those augment by generous wine and food:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What boastful son of war, without that stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Can last a hero through a single day?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Courage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mere unsupported man must yield at length;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The drooping body will desert the mind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But built anew with strength-conferring fare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dismiss the people, then, and give command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With strong repast to hearten every band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But let the presents to Achilles made,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In full assembly of all Greece be laid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of men shall rise in public sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And solemn swear (observant of the rite)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">That done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch not henceforth, O prince! thy sovereign might</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beyond the bounds of reason and of right;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis the chief praise that e’er to kings belong’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven regard me as I justly swear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here then awhile let Greece assembled stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor great Achilles grudge this short delay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till from the fleet our presents be convey’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eternal sorrows what avails to shed?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enough, when death demands the brave, to pay</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">One chief with patience to the grave resign’d,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Embodied, to the battle let us bend,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the delegates Ulysses sent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bear the presents from the royal tent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Nestor, Phyleus’ valiant heir,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Melanippus, form’d the chosen train.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the word was given, the youths obey’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A row of six fair tripods then succeeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twice the number of high-bounding steeds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seven captives next a lovely line compose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The eighth Briseis, like the blooming rose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Closed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First of the train, the golden talents bore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest in public view the chiefs dispose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drew the broad cutlass sheath’d beside his sword:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stubborn bristles from the victim’s brow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He crops, and offering meditates his vow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hands uplifted to the attesting skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On heaven’s broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solemn words a deep attention draw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Greece around sat thrill’d with sacred awe.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And mother-earth, and heaven’s revolving light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ye, fell furies of the realms of night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The black-eyed maid inviolate removes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pure and unconscious of my manly loves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred herald rolls the victim slain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus Achilles: “Hear, ye Greeks! and know</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not else Atrides could our rage inflame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas Jove’s high will alone, o’erruling all,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That doom’d our strife, and doom’d the Greeks to fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles waits ye, and expects the fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The speedy council at his word adjourn’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To their black vessels all the Greeks return’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles sought his tent. His train before</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">March’d onward, bending with the gifts they bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To their new seats the female captives move.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Briseis, radiant as the queen of love,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow as she pass’d, beheld with sad survey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where, gash’d with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once tender friend of my distracted mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now find thee cold, inanimated clay!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What woes my wretched race of life attend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sorrows on sorrows, never doom’d to end!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first loved consort of my virgin bed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My three brave brothers in one mournful day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All trod the dark, irremeable way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy friendly hand uprear’d me from the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles’ care you promised I should prove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first, the dearest partner of his love;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That rites divine should ratify the band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And make me empress in his native land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For thee, that ever felt another’s woe!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor mourn’d Patroclus’ fortunes, but their own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The leaders press’d the chief on every side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is bent to please him, this request forbear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To grief and anguish one abstemious day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and from the warriors turn’d his face:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus’ race,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy sweet society, thy winning care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once stay’d Achilles, rushing to the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now, alas! to death’s cold arms resign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What banquet but revenge can glad my mind?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What greater sorrow could afflict my breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What more if hoary Peleus were deceased?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His son’s sad fate, and drops a tender tear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What more, should Neoptolemus the brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My only offspring, sink into the grave?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fate claim’d Achilles, but might spare his friend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My tender orphan with a parent’s care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Scyros’ isle conduct him o’er the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glad his eyes with his paternal reign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lofty palace, and the large domain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or drags a wretched life of age and care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But till the news of my sad fate invades</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each stole a tear for what he left behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Is then Achilles now no more thy care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dost thou thus desert the great in war?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot the descending goddess from above.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wide air floating to her ample wings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To great Achilles she her flight address’d,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in the midst, high-towering o’er the rest,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms which the father of the fire bestow’d,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud howls the storm, and drives them o’er the main.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like the red star, that from his flaming hair</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stream’d the golden honours from his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His arms he poises, and his motions tries;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Buoy’d by some inward force, he seems to swim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now he shakes his great paternal spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Pelion’s cloudy top an ash entire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old Chiron fell’d, and shaped it for his sire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A spear which stern Achilles only wields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Automedon and Alcimus prepare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ivory-studded reins, return’d behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Waved o’er their backs, and to the chariot join’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The charioteer then whirl’d the lash around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And swift ascended at one active bound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the host, all terrible he stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges’ strain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And learn to make your master more your care:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seem’d sensible of woe, and droop’d his head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Trembling he stood before the golden wain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bow’d to dust the honours of his mane.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When, strange to tell! (so Juno will’d) he broke</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy rage in safety through the files of war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But come it will, the fatal time must come,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Confess’d we saw him) tore his arms away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No—could our swiftness o’er the winds prevail,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or beat the pinions of the western gale,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All were in vain—the Fates thy death demand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Due to a mortal and immortal hand.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With unabated rage—“So let it be!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Portents and prodigies are lost on me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I know my fate: to die, to see no more</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My much-loved parents, and my native shore—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enough—when heaven ordains, I sink in night:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now perish Troy!” He said, and rush’d to fight.</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK XX.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Jupiter, upon Achilles’ return to the battle, 
calls a council of the gods, and permits them to assist either party. 
The terrors of the combat described, when the deities are engaged. 
Apollo encourages Æneas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, 
these two heroes encounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of 
Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the 
point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. 
Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While near impending from a neighbouring height,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy’s black battalions wait the shock of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods to council in the starry hall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift o’er Olympus’ hundred hills she flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And summons all the senate of the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These shining on, in long procession come</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Jove’s eternal adamantine dome.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not one was absent, not a rural power</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each fair-hair’d dryad of the shady wood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each azure sister of the silver flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even he whose trident sways the watery reign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And question’d thus the sire of men and gods:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already met, the louring hosts appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And death stands ardent on the edge of war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This day we call the council of the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In care of human race; even Jove’s own eye</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far on Olympus’ top in secret state</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And as your minds direct, your succour lend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To either host. Troy soon must lie o’erthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If uncontroll’d Achilles fights alone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What can they now, if in his rage he rise?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assist them, gods! or Ilion’s sacred wall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On adverse parts the warring gods engage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven’s awful queen; and he whose azure round</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These to the fleet repair with instant flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vessels tremble as the gods alight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mars fiery-helm’d, the laughter-loving dame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Argive bosom swell’d with manly joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While great Achilles (terror of the plain),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pale Troy beheld, and seem’d already lost;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trembling see another god of war.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the powers descending swell’d the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mars hovering o’er his Troy, his terror shrouds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With voice divine, from Ilion’s topmost towers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The forests wave, the mountains nod around;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all their summits tremble Ida’s woods,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from their sources boil her hundred floods.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy’s turrets totter on the rocking plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the toss’d navies beat the heaving main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,<a href="#note_260" id="noteref_260" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">260</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The infernal monarch rear’d his horrid head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap’d from his throne, lest Neptune’s arm should lay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His dark dominions open to the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pour in light on Pluto’s drear abodes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Abhorr’d by men, and dreadful even to gods.<a href="#note_261" id="noteref_261" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">261</span></span></a>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The world’s vast concave, when the gods contend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First silver-shafted Phoebus took the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of arms his giant bulk display’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opposed to Pallas, war’s triumphant maid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against Latona march’d the son of May.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The quiver’d Dian, sister of the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But called Scamander by the sons of earth.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus the gods in various league engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles glow’d with more than mortal rage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His eyes around, for Hector only burn’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To glut the god of battles with his blood.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas was the first who dared to stay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo wedged him in the warrior’s way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But swell’d his bosom with undaunted might,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In voice and aspect, seem’d the power divine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the hero of Anchises’ strain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already have I met, nor void of fear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observed the fury of his flying spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Ida’s woods he chased us to the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Else had I sunk oppress’d in fatal fight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By fierce Achilles and Minerva’s might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where’er he moved, the goddess shone before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What mortal man Achilles can sustain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though strong in battle as a brazen tower.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the son of Jove: “That god implore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And be what great Achilles was before.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From heavenly Venus thou deriv’st thy strain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And he but from a sister of the main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An aged sea-god father of his line;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the thick troops the embolden’d hero press’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His venturous act the white-arm’d queen survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo great Æneas rushing to the war!</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our favour’d hero, let some power descend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guard his life, and add to his renown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We, the great armament of heaven, came down.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That spun so short his life’s illustrious line:<a href="#note_262" id="noteref_262" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">262</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But lest some adverse god now cross his way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Give him to know what powers assist this day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When heaven’s refulgent host appear in arms?”<a href="#note_263" id="noteref_263" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">263</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The solid globe’s eternal basis shake:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Against the might of man, so feeble known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why should celestial powers exert their own?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leave to war the fates of mortal men.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if the armipotent, or god of light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And these, in ruin and confusion hurl’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yield to our conquering arms the lower world.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Advanced upon the field there stood a mound</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">In elder times to guard Alcides made,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The work of Trojans, with Minerva’s aid,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What time a vengeful monster of the main</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With clouds encompass’d, and a veil of air:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In circle close each heavenly party sat,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There great Achilles; bold Æneas, here.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With towering strides Æneas first advanced;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spread o’er his breast the fencing shield he bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so Pelides; furious to engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He rush’d impetuous. Such the lion’s rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though all in arms the peopled city rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To his bold spear the savage turns alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lash’d by his tail his heaving sides resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So fierce Achilles on Æneas flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stands Æneas, and his force defies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere yet the stern encounter join’d, begun</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The seed of Thetis thus to Venus’ son:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why comes Æneas through the ranks so far?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seeks he to meet Achilles’ arm in war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The partial monarch may refuse the prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ’tis his fault to love those sons too well,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An ample forest, or a fair domain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But can Achilles be so soon forgot?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once (as I think) you saw this brandish’d spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And then the great Æneas seem’d to fear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hearty haste from Ida’s mount he fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor, till he reach’d Lyrnessus, turn’d his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her lofty walls not long our progress stay’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis true, the great Æneas fled too fast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defrauded of my conquest once before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What then I lost, the gods this day restore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go; while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To this Anchises’ son: “Such words employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such we disdain; the best may be defied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unworthy the high race from which we came</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proclaim’d so loudly by the voice of fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each from illustrious fathers draws his line;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each goddess-born; half human, half divine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thetis’ this day, or Venus’ offspring dies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For when two heroes, thus derived, contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet thou further seek to learn my birth</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear how the glorious origin we prove</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dardania’s walls he raised; for Ilion, then,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The city since of many-languaged men,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was not. The natives were content to till</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shady foot of Ida’s fountful hill.<a href="#note_264" id="noteref_264" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">264</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The richest, once, of Asia’s wealthy kings;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Boreas, enamour’d of the sprightly train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Conceal’d his godhead in a flowing mane,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And coursed the dappled beauties o’er the mead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall’d kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And when along the level seas they flew,<a href="#note_265" id="noteref_265" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">265</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce on the surface curl’d the briny dew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such Erichthonius was: from him there came</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Three sons renown’d adorn’d his nuptial bed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom heaven, enamour’d, snatch’d to upper air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The two remaining sons the line divide:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First rose Laomedon from Ilus’ side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Priam, bless’d with Hector, brave and bold;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour’d pair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is our race: ’tis fortune gives us birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All human courage gives, or takes away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long in the field of words we may contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So voluble a weapon is the tongue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For every man has equal strength to rail:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Women alone, when in the streets they jar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like us they stand, encompass’d with the crowd,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vent their anger impotent and loud.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cease then—Our business in the field of fight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is not to question, but to prove our might.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To all those insults thou hast offer’d here,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Receive this answer: ’tis my flying spear.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far on his outstretch’d arm, Pelides held</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His fears were vain; impenetrable charms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through two strong plates the point its passage held,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But stopp’d, and rested, by the third repell’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Five plates of various metal, various mould,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pierced the Dardan shield’s extremest bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the shrill brass return’d a sharper sound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the slight covering of expanded hides.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas his contracted body bends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er him high the riven targe extends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And at his back perceives the quivering spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And swims before his eyes the many-colour’d light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Draws his broad blade, and at Æneas flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Æneas rousing as the foe came on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mass enormous! which in modern days</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No two of earth’s degenerate sons could raise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ocean’s god, whose earthquakes rock the ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lo! on the brink of fate Æneas stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An instant victim to Achilles’ hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His aid in vain: the man o’erpowers the god.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And can ye see this righteous chief atone</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With guiltless blood for vices not his own?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To all the gods his constant vows were paid;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The future father of the Dardan line:<a href="#note_266" id="noteref_266" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">266</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first great ancestor obtain’d his grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And still his love descends on all the race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Priam now, and Priam’s faithless kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length are odious to the all-seeing mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On great Æneas shall devolve the reign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Good as he is, to immolate or spare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pallas and I, by all that gods can bind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not even an instant to protract their fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or save one member of the sinking state;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till her last flame be quench’d with her last gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And even her crumbling ruins are no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of ocean to the fight descends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift interposed between the warrior flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And casts thick darkness o’er Achilles’ eyes.<a href="#note_267" id="noteref_267" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">267</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From great Æneas’ shield the spear he drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And at his master’s feet the weapon threw.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That done, with force divine he snatch’d on high</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smooth-gliding without step, above the heads</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till at the battle’s utmost verge they light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The godhead there (his heavenly form confess’d)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With words like these the panting chief address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What power, O prince! with force inferior far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Urged thee to meet Achilles’ arm in war?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the day decreed (for come it must)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let then the furies of that arm be known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, he left him wondering as he lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then from Achilles chased the mist away:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sudden, returning with a stream of light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scene of war came rushing on his sight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus, amazed; “What wonders strike my mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That fell this instant, vanish’d from my sword!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I thought alone with mortals to contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But powers celestial sure this foe defend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now then let others bleed.” This said, aloud</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not in me, though favour’d by the sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No god can singly such a host engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva’s rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But whatsoe’er Achilles can inspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er of active force, or acting fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thin the squadrons with my single spear.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: nor less elate with martial joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The godlike Hector warm’d the troops of Troy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus’ haughty son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deeds must decide our fate. E’en these with words</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A wood of lances rises round his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The single fight with Thetis’ godlike son;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">More safe to combat in the mingled band,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He hears, obedient to the god of light,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On Troy’s whole force with boundless fury flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First falls Iphytion, at his army’s head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mother was a Nais, of the flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown’d with snow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Hyde’s walls he ruled the lands below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The parted visage falls on equal sides:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus Achilles glories o’er the slain:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those beauteous fields where Hyllus’ waves are roll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Are thine no more.”—The insulting hero said,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left him sleeping in eternal shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dash’d their axles with no vulgar gore.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Demoleon next, Antenor’s offspring, laid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The impatient steel with full-descending sway</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resistless drove the batter’d skull before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dash’d and mingled all the brains with gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He groans away his soul: not louder roars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At Neptune’s shrine on Helice’s high shores,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ocean listens to the grateful sound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,<a href="#note_268" id="noteref_268" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">268</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youngest hope of Priam’s stooping age:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass’d:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the forbidden field he takes his flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the first folly of a youthful knight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And golden rings the double back-plate join’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rushing entrails pour’d upon the ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Hector view’d, all ghastly in his gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His soul no longer brook’d the distant fight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full in Achilles’ dreadful front he came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shook his javelin like a waving flame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more shall Hector’s and Pelides’ spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn from each other in the walks of war.”—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then with revengeful eyes he scann’d him o’er:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Come, and receive thy fate!” He spake no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector, undaunted, thus: “Such words employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such we could give, defying and defied,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I know thy force to mine superior far;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heaven alone confers success in war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And give it entrance in a braver heart.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then parts the lance: but Pallas’ heavenly breath</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bidden dart again to Hector flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And at the feet of its great master lies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles closes with his hated foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The favour’d hero in a veil of clouds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Wretch! thou hast ’scaped again; once more thy flight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If any power assist Achilles’ hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stopp’d Demuchus, great Philetor’s heir.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gigantic chief! deep gash’d the enormous blade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And for the soul an ample passage made.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Laoganus and Dardanus expire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Both in one instant from the chariot hurl’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sunk in one instant to the nether world:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This difference only their sad fates afford</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That one the spear destroy’d, and one the sword.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant’s moan,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To spare a form, an age so like thy own!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">E’er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting liver pours a flood of gore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through Mulius’ head then drove the impetuous spear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior falls, transfix’d from ear to ear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warm’d in the brain the smoking weapon lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The purple death comes floating o’er his eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He dropp’d his arm, an unassisting weight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stood all impotent, expecting fate:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his broad shoulders hew’d his crested head:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The squire, who saw expiring on the ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His prostrate master, rein’d the steeds around;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His back, scarce turn’d, the Pelian javelin gored,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch’d the servant o’er his dying lord.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a flame the winding valley fills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then o’er the stubble up the mountain flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around him wide, immense destruction pours</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As with autumnal harvests cover’d o’er,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres’ sacred floor;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When round and round, with never-wearied pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trampling steers beat out the unnumber’d grain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes’ souls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dash’d from their hoofs while o’er the dead they fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thick the groaning axles dropp’d with gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the scene of death Achilles stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is the lust of never-dying fame!</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK XXI.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.<a href="#note_269" id="noteref_269" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">269</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards 
the town, others to the river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with 
great slaughter: takes twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade 
of Patroclus; and kills Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him 
with all his waves: Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins 
Scamander: at length Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up
 the river. This combat ended, the other gods engage each other. 
Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: 
Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; 
who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor’s shape, and while he 
pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of 
retiring into their city.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of Scamander.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now to Xanthus’ gliding stream they drove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The river here divides the flying train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Part to the town fly diverse o’er the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flashing billows beat the whiten’d shores:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As the scorch’d locusts from their fields retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The clustering legions rush into the flood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles’ force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bloody lance the hero casts aside,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d with his sword, high brandish’d o’er the waves:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep groan’d the waters with the dying sound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the warm purple circled on the tide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In shoals before him fly the scaly train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confusedly heap’d they seek their inmost caves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With their rich belts their captive arms restrains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These his attendants to the ships convey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sad victims destined to Patroclus’ shade;</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The young Lycaon in his passage stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Priam; whom the hero’s hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But late made captive in his father’s land</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lopp’d the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Lemnos’ isle he sold the royal slave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Jason’s son the price demanded gave;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ransom’d prince to fair Arisbe bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ten days were past, since in his father’s reign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He felt the sweets of liberty again;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The next, that god whom men in vain withstand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now never to return! and doom’d to go</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sadder journey to the shades below.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The helm and visor he had cast aside</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With wild affright, and dropp’d upon the field</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His useless lance and unavailing shield,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And knock’d his faltering knees, the hero said:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As now the captive, whom so late I bound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not him the sea’s unmeasured deeps detain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That bar such numbers from their native plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If earth, at length this active prince can seize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach’d, and sought his knees with suppliant tears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his soul shivering at the approach of death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He kiss’d his feet, extended on the ground:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And while, above, the spear suspended stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One hand embraced them close, one stopp’d the dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus these melting words attempt his heart:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some pity to a suppliant’s name afford,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from his father, friends, and native shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A hundred oxen were his price that day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Old Altes’ daughter, and Lelegia’s heir;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow’d,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ah! one spear shall drink each brother’s gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And I succeed to slaughter’d Polydore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How from that arm of terror shall I fly?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some demon urges! ’tis my doom to die!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If ever yet soft pity touch’d thy mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah! think not me too much of Hector’s kind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus’ death.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These words, attended with a shower of tears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youth address’d to unrelenting ears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But least, the sons of Priam’s hateful race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great, the good Patroclus is no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He, far thy better, was foredoom’d to die,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seest thou not me, whom nature’s gifts adorn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The day shall come (which nothing can avert)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By night, or day, by force, or by design,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Impending death and certain fate are mine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Die then,”—He said; and as the word he spoke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While all his trembling frame confess’d his fear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And buried in his neck the reeking blade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The victor to the stream the carcase gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus insults him, floating on the wave:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus is atoned Patroclus’ honour’d shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the short absence of Achilles paid.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These boastful words provoked the raging god;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fury swells the violated flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What means divine may yet the power employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Asteropeus to mortal war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fair Peribaea’s love the god had crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With all his refluent waters circled round:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On him Achilles rush’d; he fearless stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The flood impell’d him, on Pelides’ head</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What art thou, boldest of the race of man?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose son encounters our resistless ire.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O son of Peleus! what avails to trace</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From rich Paeonia’s valleys I command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arm’d with protended spears, my native band;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wide around the floated region fills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now lift thy arm, and try that hero’s son!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One razed Achilles’ hand; the spouting blood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spun forth; in earth the fasten’d weapon stood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Its erring fury hiss’d along the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even to the middle earth; and quiver’d there.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on his foe with double fury flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The foe thrice tugg’d, and shook the rooted wood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His belly open’d with a ghastly wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the hero’s feet he panting lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the proud victor thus triumphing said,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His radiant armour tearing from the dead:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But great Saturnius is the source of mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of Peleus, Æacus, and Jove, am I.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The race of these superior far to those,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As he that thunders to the stream that flows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even Achelous might contend in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the roaring billows of the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in his deep abysses shakes with fear.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left the breathless warrior in his gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till, roll’d between the banks, it lies the food</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All scatter’d round the stream (their mightiest slain)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He vents his fury on the flying crew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mydon, Thersilochus, with Ænius, fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But from the bottom of his gulfs profound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scamander spoke; the shores return’d the sound.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In valour matchless, and in force divine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In human form, confess’d before his eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The river thus; and thus the chief replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not till within her towers the perjured train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and drove with fury on the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to the godhead of the silver bow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The yellow flood began: “O son of Jove!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was not the mandate of the sire above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full and express, that Phoebus should employ</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And make her conquer, till Hyperion’s fall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In awful darkness hide the face of all?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke in vain—The chief without dismay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rising in his rage above the shores,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From all his deep the bellowing river roars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While all before, the billows ranged on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The falling deluge whelms the hero round:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.<a href="#note_270" id="noteref_270" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">270</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaving the bank, and undermining all;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leap’d from the channel, and regain’d the land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then blacken’d the wild waves: the murmur rose:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god pursues, a huger billow throws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At every bound his clanging armour rings:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now here, now there, he turns on every side,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And winds his course before the following tide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The waves flow after, wheresoe’er he wheels,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So when a peasant to his garden brings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as he clears whate’er their passage stay’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And marks the future current with his spade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift o’er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Louder and louder purl the falling rills;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And shine in mazy wanderings o’er the plains.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still swift Scamander rolls where’er he flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first of men, but not a match for gods.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oft as he turn’d the torrent to oppose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bravely try if all the powers were foes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And still indignant bounds above the waves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wash’d from beneath him slides the slimy soil;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When thus (his eyes on heaven’s expansion thrown)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Is there no god Achilles to befriend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No power to avert his miserable end?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,<a href="#note_271" id="noteref_271" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">271</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And make my future life the sport of fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all heaven’s oracles believed in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But most of Thetis must her son complain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By Phoebus’ darts she prophesied my fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stretch’d like a hero, by a hero’s arm!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Might Hector’s spear this dauntless bosom rend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And my swift soul o’ertake my slaughter’d friend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An unregarded carcase to the sea.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus in human form address’d the chief:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The power of ocean first: “Forbear thy fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thine is the glory doom’d.” Thus spake the gods:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He springs impetuous, and invades the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all the expanded plain the waters spread;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Floating ’midst scatter’d arms; while casques of gold</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turn’d-up bucklers glitter’d as they roll’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not a whole river stops the hero’s course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While Pallas fills him with immortal force.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lifts his billows, and o’erwhelms his shores.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus to Simois! “Haste, my brother flood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And check this mortal that controls a god;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Ilion tumble from her towery height.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whelm’d under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Immersed remain this terror of the world.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No Greeks shall e’er his perish’d relics grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The watery willows hiss before the fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length the river rear’d his languid head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I faint, I sink, unequal to the fight—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I yield—Let Ilion fall; if fate decree—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah—bend no more thy fiery arms on me!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,<a href="#note_272" id="noteref_272" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">272</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So boils the imprison’d flood, forbid to flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Juno then, imperial queen of air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The burning river sends his earnest prayer:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On other gods his dreadful arm employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Submissive I desist, if thou command;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in one ruin sink the Trojan name.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His warm entreaty touch’d Saturnia’s ear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Again the branching streams begin to spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While these by Juno’s will the strife resign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warring gods in fierce contention join:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And views contending gods with careless eyes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And first assaults the radiant queen of war:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What moved thy madness, thus to disunite</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy impious hand Tydides’ javelin bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And madly bathed it in celestial gore.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which bears Jove’s thunder on its dreadful field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The adamantine aegis of her sire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There fix’d from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This at the heavenly homicide she cast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seven broad acres covers as he lies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud o’er the fields his ringing arms resound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How far Minerva’s force transcends thy own?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas’ hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And partial aid to Troy’s perfidious race.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The goddess spoke, and turn’d her eyes away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove’s Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, propp’d on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This the bright empress of the heavens survey’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, scoffing, thus to war’s victorious maid:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Lo! what an aid on Mars’s side is seen!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The smiles’ and loves’ unconquerable queen!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mark with what insolence, in open view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Minerva smiling heard, the pair o’ertook,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On earth together lay the lovers spread.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And like these heroes be the fate of all</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god of ocean dares the god of light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What sloth has seized us, when the fields around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No deed perform’d, to our Olympian sire?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suits not my greatness, or superior age:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And guard the race of proud Laomedon!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch’s prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We shared the lengthen’d labours of a year?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Troy walls I raised (for such were Jove’s commands),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Along fair Ida’s vales and pendant groves.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the circling seasons in their train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Brought back the grateful day that crown’d our pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With menace stern the fraudful king defied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our latent godhead, and the prize denied:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mad as he was, he threaten’d servile bands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And doom’d us exiles far in barbarous lands.<a href="#note_273" id="noteref_273" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">273</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And destined vengeance on the perjured king.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And not, like us, infest the faithless race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like us, their present, future sons destroy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from its deep foundations heave their Troy?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo thus: “To combat for mankind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For what is man? Calamitous by birth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They owe their life and nourishment to earth;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smile on the sun; now, wither on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To their own hands commit the frantic scene,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from the senior power submiss retires:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The quiver’d huntress of the sylvan shades:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yields to ocean’s hoary sire the prize?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But furious thus: “What insolence has driven</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What though by Jove the female plague design’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce to the feeble race of womankind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy sex’s tyrant, with a tiger’s heart?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What though tremendous in the woodland chase</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How dares thy rashness on the powers divine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Learn hence, no more unequal war to wage—”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These in her left hand lock’d, her right untied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">About her temples flies the busy bow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So, when the falcon wings her way above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet still her heart against the marble beats.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To her Latona hastes with tender care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How shall I face the dame, who gives delight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And boast my conquest, while I yield the prize.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke; and pass’d: Latona, stooping low,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Collects the scatter’d shafts and fallen bow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dishonour’d relics of Diana’s war:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Weeping, she grasp’d his knees: the ambrosial vest</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire superior smiled, and bade her show</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What heavenly hand had caused his daughter’s woe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Abash’d, she names his own imperial spouse;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo enters Ilion’s sacred town;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fear’d the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Back to Olympus, from the war’s alarms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Return the shining bands of gods in arms;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er slaughter’d heroes, and o’er rolling steeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when avenging flames with fury driven</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the red vapours purple all the sky:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And toils, and terrors, fill’d the dreadful day.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on a turret hoary Priam stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And marks the waste of his destructive hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Views, from his arm, the Trojans’ scatter’d flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the near hero rising on his sight!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And settled sorrow on his aged face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus descending, on the guards he calls:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“You to whose care our city-gates belong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Set wide your portals to the flying throng:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He comes, and desolation marks his way!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when within the walls our troops take breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phoebus rush’d forth, the flying bands to meet;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck slaughter back, and cover’d the retreat,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gladsome see their last escape from fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thither, all parch’d with thirst, a heartless train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To young Agenor force divine he gave;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Antenor’s offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wrapt in clouds, restrain’d the hand of fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When now the generous youth Achilles spies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like others fly, and be like others slain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yon line of slaughter’d Trojans lately trod.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No: with the common heap I scorn to fall—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What if they pass’d me to the Trojan wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While I decline to yonder path, that leads</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Ida’s forests and surrounding shades?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So may I reach, conceal’d, the cooling flood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As soon as night her dusky veil extends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Return in safety to my Trojan friends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What if?—But wherefore all this vain debate?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is his swiftness, ’tis in vain to fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And such his valour, that who stands must die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Howe’er ’tis better, fighting for the state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One only soul informs that dreadful frame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Jove’s sole favour gives him all his fame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and stood, collected, in his might;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all his beating bosom claim’d the fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the barb’d javelin stings his breast in vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not less resolved, Antenor’s valiant heir</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Disdainful of retreat: high held before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How proud Achilles glories in his fame!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Parents and children our just arms employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And strong and many are the sons of Troy.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great as thou art, even thou may’st stain with gore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: with matchless force the javelin flung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dismiss’d with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Assumes Agenor’s habit, voice and shape,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The furious chief still follows where he flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now o’er the fields they stretch with lengthen’d strides,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god, now distant scarce a stride before,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While all the flying troops their speed employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who ’scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sudden joy confused, and mix’d affright.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And nations breathe, deliver’d from their fate.</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK XXII.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE DEATH OF HECTOR.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector
 only stays to oppose Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and 
tries to persuade his son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her 
entreaties, but in vain. Hector consults within himself what measures to
 take; but at the advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he 
flies. Achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods 
debate concerning the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the 
aid of Achilles. She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands
 the combat, and is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot 
in the sight of Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and 
despair. Their cries reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of 
this, was retired into the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to 
the walls, and beholds her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. 
Her excess of grief and lamentation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on the battlements of Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There safe they wipe the briny drops away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drown in bowls the labours of the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close to the walls, advancing o’er the fields</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">March, bending on, the Greeks’ embodied powers,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector singly stay’d: chain’d down by fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There fix’d he stood before the Scaean gate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still his bold arms determined to employ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The guardian still of long-defended Troy.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The power confess’d in all his glory burns:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And what (he cries) has Peleus’ son in view,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For not to thee to know the gods is given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unskill’d to trace the latent marks of heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While here thy frantic rage attacks a god.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief incensed—“Too partial god of day!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To check my conquests in the middle way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How few in Ilion else had refuge found!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou robb’st me of a glory justly mine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To cheat a mortal who repines in vain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to the city, terrible and strong,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With high and haughty steps he tower’d along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So the proud courser, victor of the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the near goal with double ardour flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him, as he blazing shot across the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,<a href="#note_274" id="noteref_274" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">274</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Orion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er the feebler stars exerts his rays;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Terrific glory! for his burning breath</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son, resolved Achilles’ force to dare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the sad father on the rampart stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus adjures him with extended hands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Methinks already I behold thee slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch’d beneath that fury of the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Implacable Achilles! might’st thou be</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To all the gods no dearer than to me!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How many valiant sons I late enjoy’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Their grandsire’s wealth, by right of birth their own,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Consign’d his daughter with Lelegia’s throne:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What sorrows then must their sad mother know,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What anguish I? unutterable woe!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bitter dregs of fortune’s cup to drain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And number all his days by miseries!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My heroes slain, my bridal bed o’erturn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My daughters ravish’d, and my city burn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My bleeding infants dash’d against the floor;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The last sad relic of my ruin’d state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stain the pavement of my regal hall;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where famish’d dogs, late guardians of my door,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall lick their mangled master’s spatter’d gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! ’tis well;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Well have they perish’d, for in fight they fell.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dust the reverend lineaments deform,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This, this is misery! the last, the worse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and acting what no words could say,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rent from his head the silver locks away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With him the mournful mother bears a part;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector’s heart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The zone unbraced, her bosom she display’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Have mercy on me, O my son! revere</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If ever thee in these fond arms I press’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against his rage if singly thou proceed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should’st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should’st thou bleed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bier,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far from our pious rites those dear remains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Must feast the vultures on the naked plains.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But fix’d remains the purpose of his soul;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expects the hero’s terrible advance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So, roll’d up in his den, the swelling snake</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beholds the traveller approach the brake;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have gather’d half the poisons of the plains;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stood, and question’d thus his mighty mind:<a href="#note_275" id="noteref_275" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">275</span></span></a>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall proud Polydamas before the gate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proclaim, his counsels are obey’d too late,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which timely follow’d but the former night,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">That wise advice rejected with disdain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I feel my folly in my people slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Methinks my suffering country’s voice I hear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But most her worthless sons insult my ear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On my rash courage charge the chance of war,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">No—if I e’er return, return I must</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yet suppose these measures I forego,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach unarm’d, and parley with the foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And treat on terms of peace to save the town:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With honourable justice to restore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And add half Ilion’s yet remaining store,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But why this thought? Unarm’d if I should go,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We greet not here, as man conversing man,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Met at an oak, or journeying o’er a plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No season now for calm familiar talk,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War is our business, but to whom is given</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot trembling rays that glitter’d o’er the land;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like Jove’s own lightning, or the rising sun.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles follows like the winged wind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One urged by fury, one by fear impell’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now circling round the walls their course maintain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next by Scamander’s double source they bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With exhalations steaming to the skies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That the green banks in summer’s heat o’erflows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose polish’d bed receives the falling rills;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm’d by Greece)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">By these they pass’d, one chasing, one in flight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No vulgar victim must reward the day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prize contended was great Hector’s life.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when some hero’s funerals are decreed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In grateful honour of the mighty dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with them turns the raised spectator’s soul:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom, while eager on the chase they look,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My heart partakes the generous Hector’s pain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Ida’s summits, and the towers of Troy:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now see him flying; to his fears resign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Consult, ye powers! (’tis worthy your debate)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whether to snatch him from impending fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Pallas thus: “Shall he whose vengeance forms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall he prolong one Trojan’s forfeit breath?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A man, a mortal, pre-ordain’d to death!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And will no murmurs fill the courts above?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Go then (return’d the sire) without delay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As through the forest, o’er the vale and lawn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-breath’d beagle drives the flying fawn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The certain hound his various maze pursues.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus step by step, where’er the Trojan wheel’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There swift Achilles compass’d round the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What god, O muse, assisted Hector’s force</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fate itself so long to hold the course?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Achilles, lest some Greek’s advance</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sign’d to the troops to yield his foe the way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leave untouch’d the honours of the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove lifts the golden balances, that show</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fates of mortal men, and things below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here each contending hero’s lot he tries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector’s fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See, where in vain he supplicates above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Roll’d at the feet of unrelenting Jove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obey’d; and rested, on his lance reclined</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While like Deiphobus the martial dame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In show an aid, by hapless Hector’s side</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Approach’d, and greets him thus with voice belied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of this distress, and sorrow’d in thy flight:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It fits us now a noble stand to make,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And here, as brothers, equal fates partake.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then he: “O prince! allied in blood and fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dearer than all that own a brother’s name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since you, of all our numerous race alone</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defend my life, regardless of your own.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Again the goddess: “Much my father’s prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And much my mother’s, press’d me to forbear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But stronger love impell’d, and I obey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fraudful she said; then swiftly march’d before:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now some god within me bids me try</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And for a moment’s space suspend the day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let Heaven’s high powers be call’d to arbitrate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The just conditions of this stern debate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Eternal witnesses of all below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stripp’d of its arms alone (the conqueror’s due)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest to Greece uninjured I’ll restore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While anger flash’d from his disdainful eyes),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Detested as thou art, and ought to be,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such leagues as men and furious lions join,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To such I call the gods! one constant state</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rouse then thy forces this important hour,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No further subterfuge, no further chance;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and launch’d his javelin at the foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector shunn’d the meditated blow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He stoop’d, while o’er his head the flying spear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Minerva watch’d it falling on the land,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then drew, and gave to great Achilles’ hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“The life you boasted to that javelin given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prince! you have miss’d. My fate depends on Heaven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And with false terrors sink another’s mind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But know, whatever fate I am to try,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I shall not fall a fugitive at least,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My soul shall bravely issue from my breast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">End all my country’s woes, deep buried in thy heart.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The weapon flew, its course unerring held,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mortal dart; resulting with a bound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis so—Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I deem’d Deiphobus had heard my call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But he secure lies guarded in the wall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A god deceived me; Pallas, ’twas thy deed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Death and black fate approach! ’tis I must bleed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No refuge now, no succour from above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let future ages hear it, and admire!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, all collected, on Achilles flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So Jove’s bold bird, high balanced in the air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And as he moved, his figure seem’d on flame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,<a href="#note_277" id="noteref_277" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">277</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far-beaming o’er the silver host of night,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shone the point of great Achilles’ spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In his right hand he waves the weapon round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Securely cased the warrior’s body o’er.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One space at length he spies, to let in fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where ’twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gave entrance: through that penetrable part</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Furious he drove the well-directed dart:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“At last is Hector stretch’d upon the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who fear’d no vengeance for Patroclus slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, prince! you should have fear’d, what now you feel;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles absent was Achilles still:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ever honour’d, and for ever mourn’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While cast to all the rage of hostile power,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The common rites of sepulture bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To soothe a father’s and a mother’s woe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Hector’s ashes in his country rest.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Could I myself the bloody banquet join!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No—to the dogs that carcase I resign.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And giving thousands, offer thousands more;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their Hector on the pile they should not see,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Furies that relentless breast have steel’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet think, a day will come, when fate’s decree</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fate,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stretch thee here before the Scaean gate.”<a href="#note_278" id="noteref_278" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">278</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He ceased. The Fates suppress’d his labouring breath,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And his eyes stiffen’d at the hand of death;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The manly body left a load of clay,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And plaintive glides along the dreary coast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles, musing as he roll’d his eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I follow thee”—He said, and stripp’d the slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then forcing backward from the gaping wound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His manly beauty and superior size;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While some, ignobler, the great dead deface</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How changed that Hector, who like Jove of late</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter’d fate!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the slain the great Achilles stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus aloud, while all the host attends:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since now at length the powerful will of heaven</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dire destroyer to our arm has given,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is not Troy fallen already? Haste, ye powers!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See, if already their deserted towers</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But what is Troy, or glory what to me?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Divine Patroclus! Death hath seal’d his eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unwept, unhonour’d, uninterr’d he lies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Can his dear image from my soul depart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Long as the vital spirit moves my heart?</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">While strong affliction gives the feeble force:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In all the raging impotence of woe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length he roll’d in dust, and thus begun,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">One, not exempt from age and misery</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Vigorous no more, as when his young embrace</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">How many valiant sons, in early bloom,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Has that cursed hand sent headlong to the tomb!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee, Hector! last: thy loss (divinely brave)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears:</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.<a href="#note_280" id="noteref_280" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c14">280</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the 
body of Patroclus. After the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, 
where, falling asleep, the ghost of his friend appears to him, and 
demands the rites of burial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with
 mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, 
and the offering their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several 
animals, and lastly twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire 
to it. He pays libations to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) 
rise, and raise the flames. When the pile has burned all night, they 
gather the bones, place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. 
Achilles institutes the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of 
the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the 
discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various 
descriptions of which, and the various success of the several 
antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night 
following, the ghost of Patroclus appears to Achilles: the 
one-and-thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile: 
the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and the three-and-thirtieth in the 
games. The scene is generally on the sea-shore.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the sad city mourn’d her hero slain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The body soil’d with dust, and black with gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies on broad Hellespont’s resounding shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These yet assembled great Achilles holds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Not yet, my brave companions of the war,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Release your smoking coursers from the car;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, with his chariot each in order led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The troops obey’d; and thrice in order led<a href="#note_281" id="noteref_281" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">281</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his dead friend’s cold breast, and thus he said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour’d ghost</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear, and rejoice on Pluto’s dreary coast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold! Achilles’ promise is complete;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bloody Hector stretch’d before thy feet.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All to Achilles’ sable ship repair,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bristly victims hissing o’er the fire:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around the hero’s prostrate body flow’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now a band of Argive monarchs brings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glorious victor to the king of kings.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The attending heralds, as by office bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:<a href="#note_282" id="noteref_282" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">282</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hush’d by the murmurs of the rolling deep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem’d to rise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In the same robe he living wore, he came:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The form familiar hover’d o’er his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Living, I seem’d his dearest, tenderest care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now forgot, I wander in the air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And give me entrance in the realms below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But here and there the unbodied spectres chase</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vagrant dead around the dark abode,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When once we pass, the soul returns no more:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When once the last funereal flames ascend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Me fate has sever’d from the sons of earth,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fate fore-doom’d that waited from my birth:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even great and godlike thou art doom’d to fall.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Together have we lived; together bred,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One house received us, and one table fed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May mix our ashes in one common grave.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight<a href="#note_283" id="noteref_283" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">283</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more return’st thou from the realms of night?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O more than brother! Think each office paid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er can rest a discontented shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Afford at least that melancholy joy.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and with his longing arms essay’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain to grasp the visionary shade!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,<a href="#note_284" id="noteref_284" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">284</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis true, ’tis certain; man, though dead, retains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The form subsists without the body’s aid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This night my friend, so late in battle lost,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even now familiar, as in life, he came;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Alas! how different! yet how like the same!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the rosy-finger’d morn appears,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shows every mournful face with tears o’erspread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And glares on the pale visage of the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With mules and waggons sends a chosen band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To load the timber, and the pile to rear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A charge consign’d to Merion’s faithful care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With proper instruments they take the road,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First march the heavy mules, securely slow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er hills, o’er dales, o’er crags, o’er rocks they go:<a href="#note_285" id="noteref_285" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">285</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jumping, high o’er the shrubs of the rough ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock’d axles bound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when arrived at Ida’s spreading woods,<a href="#note_286" id="noteref_286" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">286</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Fair Ida, water’d with descending floods,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the slow mules the same rough road return.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There on the spot which great Achilles show’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Circling around the place, where times to come</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall view Patroclus’ and Achilles’ tomb.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero bids his martial troops appear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on their cars in all the pomp of war;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All mount their chariots, combatants and squires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chariots first proceed, a shining train;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next these the melancholy band appear;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles next, oppress’d with mighty woe,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Supporting with his hands the hero’s head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bends o’er the extended body of the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus decent on the appointed ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his head divides the yellow hair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those curling locks which from his youth he vow’d,<a href="#note_287" id="noteref_287" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">287</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sacred grew, to Sperchius’ honour’d flood:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And roll’d his eyes around the watery waste:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Delightful roll along my native coast!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom we vainly vow’d, at our return,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And where in shade of consecrated bowers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So vow’d my father, but he vow’d in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more Achilles sees his native plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Patroclus bears them to the shades below.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus o’er Patroclus while the hero pray’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the sun had set upon their woe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Permit the mourning legions to retire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pious care be ours, the dead to burn—”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: the people to their ships return:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While those deputed to inter the slain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.<a href="#note_288" id="noteref_288" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">288</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The growing structure spreads on every side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on the top the manly corse they lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles covered with their fat the dead,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the piled victims round the body spread;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suspends around, low-bending o’er the pile.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fall two, selected to attend their lord,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then last of all, and horrible to tell,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.<a href="#note_289" id="noteref_289" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">289</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On these the rage of fire victorious preys,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Involves and joins them in one common blaze.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smear’d with the bloody rites, he stands on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:<a href="#note_290" id="noteref_290" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">290</span></span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hear, and exult, on Pluto’s dreary coast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold Achilles’ promise fully paid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Twelve Trojan heroes offer’d to thy shade;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But heavier fates on Hector’s corse attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Celestial Venus hover’d o’er his head,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She watch’d him all the night and all the day,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor sacred Phoebus less employ’d his care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He pour’d around a veil of gather’d air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And victims promised, and libations cast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He call’d the aerial powers, along the skies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The winged Iris heard the hero’s call,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And instant hasten’d to their airy hall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where in old Zephyr’s open courts on high,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rocky pavement glitter’d with the show.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All from the banquet rise, and each invites</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The various goddess to partake the rites.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven is feasting on the world’s green end</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far on the extremest limits of the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Peleus’ son entreats, with sacrifice,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let on Patroclus’ pile your blast be driven,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the word she vanish’d from their view;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss’d before.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the wide main then stooping from the skies,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till on the pile the gather’d tempest falls.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The structure crackles in the roaring fires,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the night the plenteous flame aspires.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All night Achilles hails Patroclus’ soul,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With large libations from the golden bowl.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As a poor father, helpless and undone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mourns o’er the ashes of an only son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So stay’d Achilles, circling round the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So watch’d the flames, till now they flame no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas when, emerging through the shades of night.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The morning planet told the approach of light;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, fast behind, Aurora’s warmer ray</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the broad ocean pour’d the golden day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to their caves the whistling winds return’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First let us quench the yet remaining flame</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero’s bones with careful view select:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Apart, and easy to be known they lie</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rest around the margin will be seen</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These wrapp’d in double cauls of fat, prepare;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in the golden vase dispose with care;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There let them rest with decent honour laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A common structure on the humble sands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And late posterity record our praise!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide o’er the pile the sable wine they throw,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next the white bones his sad companions place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tears collected, in the golden vase.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred relics to the tent they bore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The urn a veil of linen covered o’er.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High in the midst they heap the swelling bed</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The swarming populace the chief detains,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Skill’d in the needle, and the labouring loom;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of twenty measures its capacious size.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The second victor claims a mare unbroke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The third, a charger yet untouch’d by flame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Four ample measures held the shining frame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An ample double bowl contents the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These in fair order ranged upon the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero, rising, thus address’d the train:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the brave rulers of the racing steed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Should our immortal coursers take the plain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A race unrivall’d, which from ocean’s god</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Peleus received, and on his son bestow’d.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But this no time our vigour to display;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And trail those graceful honours on the sand!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Let others for the noble task prepare,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who trust the courser and the flying car.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fired at his word the rival racers rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And skill’d to manage the high-bounding steed.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With equal ardour bold Tydides swell’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Which late obey’d the Dardan chief’s command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When scarce a god redeem’d him from his hand).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then Menelaus his Podargus brings,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the famed courser of the king of kings:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To ’scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Æthe her name) at home to end his days;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next him Antilochus demands the course</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prudent son with unattending ears.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Neptune and Jove on thee conferr’d the skill</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To guide thy conduct little precept needs;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Compare those rivals’ judgment and thy own:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to be swift is less than to be wise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By art the pilot, through the boiling deep</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And ’tis the artist wins the glorious course;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And short, or wide, the ungovern’d courser drive:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The knowing racer to his end proceeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d on the goal his eye foreruns the course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hand unerring steers the steady horse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now contracts, or now extends the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observing still the foremost on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mark then the goal, ’tis easy to be found;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of some once stately oak the last remains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or hardy fir, unperish’d with the rains:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And round, a circle for the wheeling car.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bear close to this, and warily proceed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A little bending to the left-hand steed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But urge the right, and give him all the reins;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thy strict hand his fellow’s head restrains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wheel’s round naves appear to brush the goal.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clear of the stony heap direct the course;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A joy to others, a reproach to me.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or the famed race, through all the regions known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That whirl’d the car of proud Laomedon.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The last, but not least ardent for the prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Roll’d in his helmet, these Achilles throws).</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And next the brother of the king of men:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They stand in order, an impatient train:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pelides points the barrier on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sends before old Phoenix to the place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To mark the racers, and to judge the race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At once the coursers from the barrier bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The lifted scourges all at once resound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And up the champaign thunder from the shore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Each o’er his flying courser hung in air,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now (the last compass fetch’d around the goal)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At the near prize each gathers all his soul,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each burns with double hope, with double pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close on Eumelus’ back they puff the wind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seem just mounting on his car behind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, hovering o’er, their stretching shadows sees.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His matchless horses’ labour on the plain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Snatch’d from his hope the glories of the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She breaks his rival’s chariot from the yoke:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more their way the startled horses held;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The car reversed came rattling on the field;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His batter’d face and elbows strike the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish’d wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before him far the glad Tydides flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Minerva’s spirit drives his matchless pace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And crowns him victor of the labour’d race.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not that we hope to match Tydides’ horse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gives their lord the honours of the day;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your swiftness? vanquish’d by a female foe?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The last ignoble gift be all we gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No more shall Nestor’s hand your food supply,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The old man’s fury rises, and ye die.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Presents the occasion, could we use it right.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus he. The coursers at their master’s threat</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now Antilochus with nice survey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Observes the compass of the hollow way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fast by the road a precipice was worn:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Spartan hero’s chariot smoked along.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wonders at the rashness of his foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or both must fall.”—Atrides cried in vain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far as an able arm the disk can send,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When youthful rivals their full force extend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His horse compell’d; foreboding in his fears</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go, but expect not I’ll the prize resign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With fainting knees shall labour in the course,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And yield the glory yours.”—The steeds obey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Already at their heels they wing their way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seem already to retrieve the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coursers bounding o’er the dusty field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The first who mark’d them was the Cretan king;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High on a rising ground, above the ring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He well observed the chief who led the way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heard from far his animating cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And saw the foremost steed with sharpen’d eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Are yonder horse discern’d by me alone?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or can ye, all, another chief survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And other steeds than lately led the way?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lie sure disabled in the middle field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I search to find them, but I search in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perchance the reins forsook the driver’s hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, turn’d too short, he tumbled on the strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With frantic fury from the destined way.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rise then some other, and inform my sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Ætolian chief, renown’d in war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Eumelus’ steeds, high bounding in the chase,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still, as at first, unrivall’d lead the race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And hear his shouts victorious o’er the plain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The last in merit, as the first in pride!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To vile reproach what answer can we make?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A goblet or a tripod let us stake,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And be the king the judge. The most unwise</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To fell extremes. But Thetis’ godlike son</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er his head the circling lash he wields:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The track his flying wheels had left behind:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So swift, it seem’d a flight, and not a race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These to the ships his train triumphant leads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erpass’d Atrides) second in the course.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Than to the courser in his swift career</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The following car, just touching with his heel</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such, and so narrow now the space between</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The rivals, late so distant on the green;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One length, one moment, had the race obtain’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Merion pursued, at greater distance still,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Slow dragged the steeds his batter’d chariot on:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Since great Tydides bears the first away)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him the second honours of the day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And then Eumelus had received the prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The award opposes, and asserts his claim.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O Peleus’ son! the mare so justly mine.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What if the gods, the skilful to confound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vows omitted forfeited the prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And please a soul desirous to bestow)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An ample present let him thence receive,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But this my prize I never shall forego;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased with the well-turn’d flattery of a friend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles smiled: “The gift proposed (he cried),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With plates of brass the corslet cover’d o’er,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The same renown’d Asteropaeus wore,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: Automedon at his command</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Distinguish’d by his friend, his bosom glows</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And still’d the clamour of the shouting bands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not without cause incensed at Nestor’s son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And inly grieving, thus the king begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Robb’d of my glory and my just reward,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So not a leader shall our conduct blame,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or judge me envious of a rival’s fame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What needs appealing in a fact so plain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And vindicate by oath th’ ill-gotten prize?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prudent chief with calm attention heard;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then mildly thus: “Excuse, if youth have err’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou know’st the errors of unripen’d age,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mare, or aught thou ask’st, be freely thine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So spoke Antilochus; and at the word</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mare contested to the king restored.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fields their vegetable life renew,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such joy the Spartan’s shining face o’erspread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis now Atrides’ turn to yield to thee.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not but (my friend) ’tis still the wiser way</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To waive contention with superior sway;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suffice thy father’s merit and thy own:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Generous alike, for me, the sire and son</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have greatly suffer’d, and have greatly done.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor is my pride preferr’d before my friend.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and pleased his passion to command,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Resign’d the courser to Noemon’s hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The shining charger to his vessel sent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The golden talents Merion next obtain’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus the purpose of his gift declares:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ever snatch’d from our desiring eyes!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Take thou this token of a grateful heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though ’tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But left the glory of the past thy own.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and placed the goblet at his side;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joy the venerable king replied:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A senior honour’d, and a friend beloved!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Too true it is, deserted of my strength,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These wither’d arms and limbs have fail’d at length.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Victorious then in every solemn game,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ordain’d to Amarynces’ mighty name;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brave Epeians gave my glory way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ætolians, Pylians, all resign’d the day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I quell’d Clytomedes in fights of hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And backward hurl’d Ancaeus on the sand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Surpass’d Iphyclus in the swift career,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But won by numbers, not by art or force:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For the famed twins, impatient to survey</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sprung to their car; and with united pains</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One lash’d the coursers, while one ruled the reins.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A younger race, that emulate our deeds:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though once the foremost hero of the field.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With martial honours decorate the dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not one but honours sacred age and me:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May the just gods return another day!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The prizes next are order’d to the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For the bold champions who the caestus wield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of six years’ age, unconscious of the yoke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles rising, thus: “Let Greece excite</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The vanquish’d bear the massy bowl away.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;<a href="#note_291" id="noteref_291" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">291</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And seized the beast, and thus began to say:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Others, ’tis own’d, in fields of battle shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But the first honours of this fight are mine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For who excels in all? Then let my foe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To heave the batter’d carcase off the plain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The host beheld him, silent with amaze!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The games ordain’d dead OEdipus to grace,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him great Tydides urges to contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Officious with the cincture girds him round;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the circle now each champion stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And poises high in air his iron hands;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And painful sweat from all their members flows.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Beneath that ponderous arm’s resistless sway</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down dropp’d he, nerveless, and extended lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By some huge billow dash’d against the shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lies panting; not less batter’d with his wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And dragging his disabled legs along;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o’er;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;<a href="#note_292" id="noteref_292" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">292</span></span></a>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wrapp’d round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The third bold game Achilles next demands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A massy tripod for the victor lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of twice six oxen its reputed price;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And next, the loser’s spirits to restore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A female captive, valued but at four.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Embracing rigid with implicit hands.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Close lock’d above, their heads and arms are mix’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Below, their planted feet at distance fix’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their tops connected, but at wider space</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fix’d on the centre stands their solid base.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now to the grasp each manly body bends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The humid sweat from every pore descends;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The watchful caution of his artful foe.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While the long strife even tired the lookers on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He barely stirr’d him, but he could not raise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His knee lock’d fast, the foe’s attempt denied;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Defiled with honourable dust they roll,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Again they rage, again to combat rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When great Achilles thus divides the prize:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye both have won: let others who excel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now prove that prowess you have proved so well.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero’s words the willing chiefs obey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, clothed anew, the following games survey.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now succeed the gifts ordain’d to grace</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youths contending in the rapid race:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A silver urn that full six measures held,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By none in weight or workmanship excell’d:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Elaborate, with artifice divine;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From him descended, good Eunaeus heir’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now, the same hero’s funeral rites to grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A well-fed ox was for the second placed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And half a talent must content the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles rising then bespoke the train:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero said, and starting from his place,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oilean Ajax rises to the race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His youthful equals, Nestor’s son, the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pelides points the barrier with his hand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All start at once; Oileus led the race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behind him, diligently close, he sped,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As closely following as the running thread</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The spindle follows, and displays the charms</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And send their souls before him as he flies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now three times turn’d in prospect of the goal,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Assist, O goddess!” thus in thought he pray’d!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And present at his thought descends the maid.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Buoy’d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(O’erturn’d by Pallas), where the slippery shore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was clogg’d with slimy dung and mingled gore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The self-same place beside Patroclus’ pyre,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where late the slaughter’d victims fed the fire.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Besmear’d with filth, and blotted o’er with clay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left the urn Ulysses’ rich reward.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The baffled hero thus the Greeks address’d:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She urged her favourite on the rapid way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus sourly wail’d he, sputtering dirt and gore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Why with our wiser elders should we strive?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods still love them, and they always thrive.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A green old age unconscious of decays,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That proves the hero born in better days!)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold his vigour in this active race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For who can match Achilles? He who can,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Must yet be more than hero, more than man.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Receive a talent of the purest gold.”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The youth departs content. The host admire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now grace the lists before our army’s sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who first the jointed armour shall explore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And stain his rival’s mail with issuing gore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sword Asteropaeus possess’d of old,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker’s side:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These arms in common let the chiefs divide:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For each brave champion, when the combat ends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus’ son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A furious pass the spear of Ajax made</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus the foe: his javelin aim’d above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The buckler’s margin, at the neck he drove.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Greece, now trembling for her hero’s life,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet still the victor’s due Tydides gains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With him the sword and studded belt remains.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then hurl’d the hero, thundering on the ground,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A mass of iron (an enormous round),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from his whirling arm dismiss in air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The giant by Achilles slain, he stow’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Among his spoils this memorable load.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That teach the disk to sound along the sky.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If he be one enrich’d with large domain</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Small stock of iron needs that man provide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From hence; nor ask the neighbouring city’s aid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Stern Polypoetes stepp’d before the throng,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose force with rival forces to oppose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Uprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">High o’er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Leonteus next a little space surpass’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Polypoetes’ arm the discus sung:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That distant falls among the grazing cows,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So past them all the rapid circle flies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With force conjoin’d heave off the weighty prize.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those, who in skilful archery contend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He next invites the twanging bow to bend;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And twice ten axes casts amidst the round,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The hero fixes in the sandy shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The trembling mark at which their arrows fly.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These two-edged axes, terrible in war;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said: experienced Merion took the word;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But flies unbless’d! No grateful sacrifice,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To Phoebus, patron of the shaft and bow.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For this, thy well-aim’d arrow turn’d aside,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Err’d from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Adown the mainmast fell the parted string,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And the free bird to heaven displays her wing:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And Merion eager meditates the wound:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And following with his eye the soaring dove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Implores the god to speed it through the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Quite through and through the point its passage found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With flagging wings alighted on the mast,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then sudden dropp’d, and left her life in air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To close the funeral games, Achilles last</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A massy spear amid the circle placed,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">With flowers high-wrought, not blacken’d yet by flame.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For these he bids the heroes prove their art,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor here disdain’d the king of men to rise.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pleased from the hero’s lips his praise to hear,</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">BOOK XXIV.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The gods deliberate about the redemption of 
Hector’s body. Jupiter sends Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the 
restoring it, and Iris to Priam, to encourage him to go in person and 
treat for it. The old king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his 
queen, makes ready for the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen
 from Jupiter. He sets forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with 
presents, under the charge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the
 shape of a young man, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. 
Their conversation on the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts 
himself at his feet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved 
with compassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, 
and the next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out 
to meet him. The lamentations of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the
 solemnities of the funeral.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The time of twelve days is employed in this 
book, while the body of Hector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many
 more are spent in the truce allowed for his interment. The scene is 
partly in Achilles’ camp, and partly in Troy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now from the finish’d games the Grecian band</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All stretch’d at ease the genial banquet share,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friend’s dear image present to his mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Restless he roll’d around his weary bed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All pass’d before him in remembrance dear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then starting up, disconsolate he goes</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There as the solitary mourner raves,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The ruddy morning rises o’er the waves:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join’d!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Was Hector dragg’d, then hurried to the tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sleep at last o’ercomes the hero’s eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While foul in dust the unhonour’d carcase lies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But not deserted by the pitying skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For Phoebus watch’d it with superior care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, ignominious as it swept the field,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Spread o’er the sacred corse his golden shield.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All heaven was moved, and Hermes will’d to go</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And th’ unrelenting empress of the skies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">E’er since that day implacable to Troy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But when the tenth celestial morning broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still grudge his body to the Trojans’ view?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The last sad honours of a funeral fire?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is then the dire Achilles all your care?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That iron heart, inflexibly severe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The greatest evil and the greatest good.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still for one loss he rages unresign’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To lose a friend, a brother, or a son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But Hector only boasts a mortal claim,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles, of your own ethereal race,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yourselves were present; where this minstrel-god,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Howe’er by stealth to snatch the corse away,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We will not: Thetis guards it night and day.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But haste, and summon to our courts above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The azure queen; let her persuasion move</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He added not: and Iris from the skies,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Meteorous the face of ocean sweeps,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Refulgent gliding o’er the sable deeps.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Between where Samos wide his forests spreads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And rocky Imbrus lifts its pointed heads,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Down plunged the maid; (the parted waves resound;)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She plunged and instant shot the dark profound.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As bearing death in the fallacious bait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the bent angle sinks the leaden weight;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So pass’d the goddess through the closing wave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where Thetis sorrow’d in her secret cave:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There placed amidst her melancholy train</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The blue-hair’d sisters of the sacred main)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pensive she sat, revolving fates to come,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And wept her godlike son’s approaching doom.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus the goddess of the painted bow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Arise, O Thetis! from thy seats below,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Tis Jove that calls.”—“And why (the dame replies)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Calls Jove his Thetis to the hated skies?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sad object as I am for heavenly sight!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah may my sorrows ever shun the light!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Howe’er, be heaven’s almighty sire obey’d—”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She spake, and veil’d her head in sable shade,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Which, flowing long, her graceful person clad;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And forth she paced, majestically sad.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then through the world of waters they repair</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The way fair Iris led) to upper air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The deeps dividing, o’er the coast they rise,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And touch with momentary flight the skies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There in the lightning’s blaze the sire they found,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all the gods in shining synod round.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thetis approach’d with anguish in her face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Minerva rising, gave the mourner place,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even Juno sought her sorrows to console,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And offer’d from her hand the nectar-bowl:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She tasted, and resign’d it: then began</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sacred sire of gods and mortal man:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thou comest, fair Thetis, but with grief o’ercast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Maternal sorrows; long, ah, long to last!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suffice, we know and we partake thy cares;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But yield to fate, and hear what Jove declares.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nine days are past since all the court above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In Hector’s cause have moved the ear of Jove;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">’Twas voted, Hermes from his godlike foe</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">By stealth should bear him, but we will’d not so:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">We will, thy son himself the corse restore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And to his conquest add this glory more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then hie thee to him, and our mandate bear:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor let him more (our anger if he dread)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But yield to ransom and the father’s prayer;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mournful father, Iris shall prepare</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With gifts to sue; and offer to his hands</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whate’er his honour asks, or heart demands.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His word the silver-footed queen attends,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And from Olympus’ snowy tops descends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Arrived, she heard the voice of loud lament,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And echoing groans that shook the lofty tent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His friends prepare the victim, and dispose</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Repast unheeded, while he vents his woes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The goddess seats her by her pensive son,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">She press’d his hand, and tender thus begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“How long, unhappy! shall thy sorrows flow,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thy heart waste with life-consuming woe:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mindless of food, or love, whose pleasing reign</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soothes weary life, and softens human pain?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O snatch the moments yet within thy power;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not long to live, indulge the amorous hour!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! Jove himself (for Jove’s command I bear)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No longer then (his fury if thou dread)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Detain the relics of great Hector dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But yield to ransom, and restore the slain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom Achilles: “Be the ransom given,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">While thus they communed, from the Olympian bowers</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove orders Iris to the Trojan towers:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still, still for Hector let our sorrows flow,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expired not meanly, in unactive death?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He poured his latest blood in manly fight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fell a hero in his country’s right.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Seek not to stay me, nor my soul affright</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A present goddess brought the high command,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Lo! the sad father, frantic with his pain,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each office hurts him, and each face offends.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“What make ye here, officious crowds! (he cries):</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have ye no griefs at home, to fix ye there:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Am I the only object of despair?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Am I become my people’s common show,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">No, you must feel him too; yourselves must fall;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But if the god his augury denies,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suppress thy impulse, nor reject advice.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“’Tis just (said Priam) to the sire above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To raise our hands; for who so good as Jove?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The purest water of the living spring:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then took the golden cup his queen had fill’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O first and greatest! heaven’s imperial lord!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To stern Achilles now direct my ways,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And teach him mercy when a father prays.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">If such thy will, despatch from yonder sky</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">As stooping dexter with resounding wings</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The imperial bird descends in airy rings.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A dawn of joy in every face appears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mourning matron dries her timorous tears:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The brazen portal in his passage rung;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The mules preceding draw the loaded wain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Charged with the gifts: Idaeus holds the rein:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king himself his gentle steeds controls,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And through surrounding friends the chariot rolls.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his slow wheels the following people wait,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Mourn at each step, and give him up to fate;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With hands uplifted eye him as he pass’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And gaze upon him as they gazed their last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now forward fares the father on his way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the lone fields, and back to Ilion they.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Great Jove beheld him as he cross’d the plain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And felt the woes of miserable man.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then thus to Hermes: “Thou whose constant cares</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Behold an object to thy charge consign’d:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The god obeys, his golden pinions binds,<a href="#note_294" id="noteref_294" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref c17"><span class="c14">294</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er the wide earth, and o’er the boundless main;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">A beauteous youth, majestic and divine,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">What time the herald and the hoary king</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Their chariots stopping at the silver spring,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">That circling Ilus’ ancient marble flows)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Allow’d their mules and steeds a short repose,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through the dim shade the herald first espies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A man’s approach, and thus to Priam cries:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">This hard adventure claims thy utmost care!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For much I fear destruction hovers nigh:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our state asks counsel; is it best to fly?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or old and helpless, at his feet to fall,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two wretched suppliants, and for mercy call?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The afflicted monarch shiver’d with despair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pale grew his face, and upright stood his hair;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sunk was his heart; his colour went and came;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A sudden trembling shook his aged frame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">When Hermes, greeting, touch’d his royal hand,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, gentle, thus accosts with kind demand:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Say whither, father! when each mortal sight</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is seal’d in sleep, thou wanderest through the night?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Through Grecian foes, so numerous and so strong?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What couldst thou hope, should these thy treasures view;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">For what defence, alas! could’st thou provide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thyself not young, a weak old man thy guide?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From me no harm shall touch thy reverend head;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From Greece I’ll guard thee too; for in those lines</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The living image of my father shines.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Thy words, that speak benevolence of mind,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hail, and be bless’d! For scarce of mortal kind</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Nor true are all thy words, nor erring wide;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">What yet most precious of thy store remains,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To lodge in safety with some friendly hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Prepared, perchance, to leave thy native land?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or fliest thou now?—What hopes can Troy retain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thy matchless son, her guard and glory, slain?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king, alarm’d: “Say what, and whence thou art</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who search the sorrows of a parent’s heart,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And know so well how godlike Hector died?”</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus Priam spoke, and Hermes thus replied:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“You tempt me, father, and with pity touch:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On this sad subject you inquire too much.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Oft have these eyes that godlike Hector view’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In glorious fight, with Grecian blood embrued:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I saw him when, like Jove, his flames he toss’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On thousand ships, and wither’d half a host:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">I saw, but help’d not: stern Achilles’ ire</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forbade assistance, and enjoy’d the fire.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For him I serve, of Myrmidonian race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One ship convey’d us from our native place;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Polyctor is my sire, an honour’d name,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Old like thyself, and not unknown to fame;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of seven his sons, by whom the lot was cast</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To watch this quarter, my adventure falls:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And scarce their rulers check their martial rage.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“If then thou art of stern Pelides’ train,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The mournful monarch thus rejoin’d again,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Ah tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My son’s dear relics? what befalls him dead?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Have dogs dismember’d (on the naked plains),</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“O favour’d of the skies! (thus answered then</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The power that mediates between god and men)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But whole he lies, neglected in the tent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This the twelfth evening since he rested there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Untouch’d by worms, untainted by the air.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still as Aurora’s ruddy beam is spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Round his friend’s tomb Achilles drags the dead:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet undisfigured, or in limb or face,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All fresh he lies, with every living grace,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Majestical in death! No stains are found</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er all the corse, and closed is every wound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Though many a wound they gave. Some heavenly care,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some hand divine, preserves him ever fair:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Or all the host of heaven, to whom he led</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A life so grateful, still regard him dead.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus spoke to Priam the celestial guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And joyful thus the royal sire replied:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Blest is the man who pays the gods above</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The constant tribute of respect and love!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those who inhabit the Olympian bower</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My son forgot not, in exalted power;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And heaven, that every virtue bears in mind,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even to the ashes of the just is kind.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, O generous youth! this goblet take,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A pledge of gratitude for Hector’s sake;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And while the favouring gods our steps survey,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe to Pelides’ tent conduct my way.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the latent god: “O king, forbear</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To tempt my youth, for apt is youth to err.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But can I, absent from my prince’s sight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Take gifts in secret, that must shun the light?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What from our master’s interest thus we draw,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Is but a licensed theft that ’scapes the law.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Respecting him, my soul abjures the offence;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And as the crime, I dread the consequence.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thee, far as Argos, pleased I could convey;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On thee attend, thy safety to maintain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O’er pathless forests, or the roaring main.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, then took the chariot at a bound,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And snatch’d the reins, and whirl’d the lash around:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Before the inspiring god that urged them on,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The coursers fly with spirit not their own.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now they reach’d the naval walls, and found</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The guards repasting, while the bowls go round;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On these the virtue of his wand he tries,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And o’er the trenches led the rolling cars.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now approach’d Pelides’ lofty tent.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On firs the roof was raised, and cover’d o’er</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With reeds collected from the marshy shore;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Large was the door, whose well-compacted strength</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A solid pine-tree barr’d of wondrous length:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But great Achilles singly closed the gate.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then swift alighted the celestial guide,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And thus reveal’d—”Hear, prince! and understand</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou ow’st thy guidance to no mortal hand:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Hermes I am, descended from above,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king of arts, the messenger of Jove,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Farewell: to shun Achilles’ sight I fly;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Uncommon are such favours of the sky,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor stand confess’d to frail mortality.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Adjure him by his father’s silver hairs,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His son, his mother! urge him to bestow</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Whatever pity that stern heart can know.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus having said, he vanish’d from his eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And in a moment shot into the skies:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The king, confirm’d from heaven, alighted there,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And left his aged herald on the car,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With solemn pace through various rooms he went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And found Achilles in his inner tent:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">There sat the hero: Alcimus the brave,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And great Automedon, attendance gave:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These served his person at the royal feast;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Around, at awful distance, stood the rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unseen by these, the king his entry made:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, prostrate now before Achilles laid,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Sudden (a venerable sight!) appears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those direful hands his kisses press’d, embrued</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Even with the best, the dearest of his blood!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">As when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pursued for murder, flies his native clime)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">All mute, yet seem’d to question with their eyes:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Each look’d on other, none the silence broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">His trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In all my equal, but in misery!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Expels him helpless from his peaceful state;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Think, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And beg protection with a feeble cry.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And, hearing, still may hope a better day</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">May send him thee, to chase that foe away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Yet what a race! ere Greece to Ilion came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The pledge of many a loved and loving dame:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nineteen one mother bore—Dead, all are dead!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">How oft, alas! has wretched Priam bled!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Still one was left their loss to recompense;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His father’s hope, his country’s last defence.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Him too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy in his country’s cause he fell!</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“For him through hostile camps I bent my way,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The scourge and ruin of my realm and race;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Suppliant my children’s murderer to implore,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The old man’s cheek he gently turn’d away.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Now each by turns indulged the gush of woe;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now the mingled tides together flow:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">This low on earth, that gently bending o’er;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A father one, and one a son deplore:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But great Achilles different passions rend,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The infectious softness through the heroes ran;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One universal solemn shower began;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They bore as heroes, but they felt as man.</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Satiate at length with unavailing woes,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From the high throne divine Achilles rose;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The reverend monarch by the hand he raised;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On his white beard and form majestic gazed,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not unrelenting; then serene began</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With words to soothe the miserable man:</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Alas, what weight of anguish hast thou known,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Unhappy prince! thus guardless and alone</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To pass through foes, and thus undaunted face</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The man whose fury has destroy’d thy race!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Heaven sure has arm’d thee with a heart of steel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A strength proportion’d to the woes you feel.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Rise, then: let reason mitigate your care:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To mourn avails not: man is born to bear.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Such is, alas! the gods’ severe decree:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They, only they are blest, and only free.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two urns by Jove’s high throne have ever stood,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The source of evil one, and one of good;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">From thence the cup of mortal man he fills,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Blessings to these, to those distributes ill;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To most he mingles both: the wretch decreed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To taste the bad unmix’d, is cursed indeed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">He wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The happiest taste not happiness sincere;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But find the cordial draught is dash’d with care.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who more than Peleus shone in wealth and power</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What stars concurring bless’d his natal hour!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">A realm, a goddess, to his wishes given;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">One evil yet o’ertakes his latest day:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No race succeeding to imperial sway;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">An only son; and he, alas! ordain’d</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To fall untimely in a foreign land.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">See him, in Troy, the pious care decline</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Of his weak age, to live the curse of thine!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou too, old man, hast happier days beheld;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In riches once, in children once excell’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Extended Phrygia own’d thy ample reign,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all fair Lesbos’ blissful seats contain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And all wide Hellespont’s unmeasured main.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But since the god his hand has pleased to turn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And fill thy measure from his bitter urn,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What sees the sun, but hapless heroes’ falls?</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">War, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">What must be, must be. Bear thy lot, nor shed</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These unavailing sorrows o’er the dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou canst not call him from the Stygian shore,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But thou, alas! may’st live to suffer more!”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To whom the king: “O favour’d of the skies!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Here let me grow to earth! since Hector lies</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">On the bare beach deprived of obsequies.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">O give me Hector! to my eyes restore</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">His corse, and take the gifts: I ask no more.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thou, as thou may’st, these boundless stores enjoy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Safe may’st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from Troy;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So shall thy pity and forbearance give</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Move me no more, (Achilles thus replies,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">To yield thy Hector I myself intend:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">For know, from Jove my goddess-mother came,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Old Ocean’s daughter, silver-footed dame,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest alone,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Some god impels with courage not thy own:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">No human hand the weighty gates unbarr’d,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nor could the boldest of our youth have dared</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To pass our outworks, or elude the guard.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Cease; lest, neglectful of high Jove’s command,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Release my knees, thy suppliant arts give o’er,</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The sire obey’d him, trembling and o’eraw’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles, like a lion, rush’d abroad:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Whom most he honour’d, since he lost his friend,)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These to unyoke the mules and horses went,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And led the hoary herald to the tent;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Next, heap’d on high, the numerous presents bear,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(Great Hector’s ransom,) from the polish’d car.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Two splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">They leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then call the handmaids, with assistant toil</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To wash the body and anoint with oil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Apart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">The stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">This done, the garments o’er the corse they spread;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Achilles lifts it to the funeral bed:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then, while the body on the car they laid,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">He said, and, entering, took his seat of state;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Where full before him reverend Priam sate;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">But now the peaceful hours of sacred night</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Demand reflection, and to rest invite:</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Not thus did Niobe, of form divine,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Six youthful sons, as many blooming maids,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">In one sad day beheld the Stygian shades;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those by Apollo’s silver bow were slain,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">These, Cynthia’s arrows stretch’d upon the plain:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">So was her pride chastised by wrath divine,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Who match’d her own with bright Latona’s line;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">But two the goddess, twelve the queen enjoy’d;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Those boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy’d.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Steep’d in their blood, and in the dust outspread,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">None by to weep them, to inhume them none;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(For Jove had turn’d the nation all to stone.)</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The gods themselves, at length relenting gave</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">The unhappy race the honours of a grave.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Herself a rock (for such was heaven’s high will)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Thus gazing long, the silence neither broke,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“Permit me now, beloved of Jove! to steep</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">For, since the day that number’d with the dead</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My hapless son, the dust has been my bed;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">My only food, my sorrows and my sighs!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Till now, encouraged by the grace you give,</div>

</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">With that, Achilles bade prepare the bed,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Forth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">And place the couches, and the coverings lay.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then he: “Now, father, sleep, but sleep not here;</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Remains unask’d; what time the rites require</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">To inter thy Hector? For, so long we stay</div>
<div class="tei tei-l c16">Our slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey.”</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-lg c18">
<div class="tei tei-l c16">“If then thy will permit (the monarch said)</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Nine days to vent our sorrows I request,</div>

<div class="tei tei-l c16">Then gave his hand at parting, to prevent</div>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c12"><span class="c11">CONCLUDING NOTE.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">We have now passed through the Iliad, and seen 
the anger of Achilles, and the terrible effects of it, at an end: as 
that only was the subject of the poem, and the nature of epic poetry 
would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war, it 
perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account 
of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in this poem after the 
conclusion of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">I need not mention that Troy was taken soon 
after the death of Hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the 
particulars of which are described by Virgil in the second book of the 
Æneid.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of 
Paris, by the shot of an arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at 
his death, lib. xxii.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a 
contest with Ulysses for the armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his
 aim, he slew himself through indignation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Helen, after the death of Paris, married 
Deiphobus his brother, and at the taking of Troy betrayed him, in order 
to reconcile herself to Menelaus her first husband, who received her 
again into favour.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Agamemnon at his return was barbarously 
murdered by Ægysthus, at the instigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who 
in his absence had dishonoured his bed with Ægysthus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled 
his own country, and scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous 
wife Ægiale; but at last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared 
his kingdom; it is uncertain how he died.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Nestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea
 and land, at last returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of
 Homer’s Odyssey.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">For what remains, I beg to be excused from the 
ceremonies of taking leave at the end of my work, and from embarrassing 
myself, or others, with any defences or apologies about it. But instead 
of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or 
difficulties of it (which must be left to the world, to truth, and to 
posterity), let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one 
of the most valuable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and 
country, one who has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an
 undertaking it is to do justice to Homer, and one whom (I am sure) 
sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, 
therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to 
dedicate it, and to have the honour and satisfaction of placing 
together, in this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">“What,” says Archdeacon Wilberforce, “is the 
natural root of loyalty as distinguished from such mere selfish desire 
of personal security as is apt to take its place in civilized times, but
 that consciousness of a natural bond among the families of men which 
gives a fellow-feeling to whole clans and nations, and thus enlists 
their affections in behalf of those time-honoured representatives of 
their ancient blood, in whose success they feel a personal interest? 
Hence the delight when we recognize an act of nobility or justice in our
 hereditary princes</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">“So strong is this feeling, that it regains an 
engrafted influence even when history witnesses that vast convulsions 
have rent and weakened it and the Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has
 been rekindled in our own days towards the grand daughter of George the
 Third of Hanover.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Somewhat similar may be seen in the 
disposition to idolize those great lawgivers of man’s race, who have 
given expression, in the immortal language of song, to the deeper 
inspirations of our nature. The thoughts of Homer or of Shakespere are 
the universal inheritance of the human race. In this mutual ground every
 man meets his brother, they have been bet forth by the providence of 
God to vindicate for all of us what nature could effect, and that, in 
these representatives of our race, we might recognize our common 
benefactors.’—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">Doctrine of the Incarnation,</span></span> pp. 9, 10.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">“The voice,” observes Heeren, “was always 
accompanied by some instrument. The bard was provided with a harp on 
which he played a prelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with 
which he accompanied the song when begun. His voice probably preserved a
 medium between singing and recitation; the words, and not the melody 
were regarded by the listeners, hence it was necessary for him to remain
 intelligible to all. In countries where nothing similar is found, it is
 difficult to represent such scenes to the mind; but whoever has had an 
opportunity of listening to the improvisation of Italy, can easily form 
an idea of Demodocus and Phemius.”—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">Ancient Greece,</span></span> p. 94.</p>

 a mere romance, the ancients had a superstitious belief in the great 
age of trees which grew near places consecrated by the presence of gods 
and great men. See Cicero de Legg II I, sub init., where he speaks of 
the plane tree under which Socrates used to walk and of the tree at 
Delos, where Latona gave birth to Apollo. This passage is referred to by

<p class="tei tei-p c13">It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height 
to which the memory may be cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we 
might refer to that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a 
very short warning, to ‘rhapsodize,’ night after night, parts which when
 laid together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this
 is nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a 
gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a 
distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he 
informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining a 
man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole 
Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also to 
repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either forwards or 
backwards, or from the eighth line to the first, alternately the odd and
 even lines—in short, whatever the passage required; the memory, which 
seemed to cling to the words much more than to the sense, had it at such
 perfect command, that it could produce it under any form. Our informant
 went on to state that this singular being was proceeding to learn the 
Orlando Furioso in the same manner. But even this instance is less 
wonderful than one as to which we may appeal to any of our readers that 
happened some twenty years ago to visit the town of Stirling, in 
Scotland. No such person can have forgotten the poor, uneducated man 
Blind Jamie who could actually repeat, after a few minutes consideration
 any verse required from any part of the Bible—even the obscurest and 
most unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted. We do 
not mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the 
question before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much 
difficulty in calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be 
cultivated, are we, in these days of multifarious reading, and of 
countless distracting affairs, fair judges of the perfection to which 
the invention and the memory combined may attain in a simpler age, and 
among a more single minded people?—Quarterly Review, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">l. c.,</span></span> p. 143, sqq.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">The following argument of the Iliad, corrected 
in a few particulars, is translated from Bitaube, and is, perhaps, the 
neatest summary that has ever been drawn up:—“A hero, injured by his 
general, and animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and 
for a season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this 
interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been 
occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of which
 the honour of their country depends. The general, at length opening his
 eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the principal 
officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission to make 
compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent presents. The 
hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character, persists in his
 animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of entire 
destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this friend weeps before 
him, and asks for the hero’s arms, and for permission to go to the war 
in his stead. The eloquence of friendship prevails more than the 
intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of the general. He lends 
his armour to his friend, but commands him not to engage with the chief 
of the enemy’s army, because he reserves to himself the honour of that 
combat, and because he also fears for his friend’s life. The prohibition
 is forgotten; the friend listens to nothing but his courage; his corpse
 is brought back to the hero, and the hero’s arms become the prize of 
the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to the most lively despair, 
prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new armour, is reconciled
 with his general and, thirsting for glory and revenge, enacts prodigies
 of valour, recovers the victory, slays the enemy’s chief, honours his 
friend with superb funeral rites, and exercises a cruel vengeance on the
 body of his destroyer; but finally appeased by the tears and prayers of
 the father of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse of 
his son, which he buries with due solemnities.’—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.</p>

 “The Apollo of Homer, it must be borne in mind, is a different 
character from the deity of the same name in the later classical 
pantheon. Throughout both poems, all deaths from unforeseen or invisible
 causes, the ravages of pestilence, the fate of the young child or 
promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or flower of youth, of 
the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or of the reckless 
sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are ascribed to the 
arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of the god rose 
naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for who could more 
appropriately impart to mortals what little foreknowledge Fate permitted
 of her decrees than the agent of her most awful dispensations? The 
close union of the arts of prophecy and song explains his additional 
office of god of music, while the arrows with which he and his sister 
were armed, symbols of sudden death in every age, no less naturally 
procured him that of god of archery. Of any connection between Apollo 
and the Sun, whatever may have existed in the more esoteric doctrine of 
the Greek sanctuaries, there is no trace in either Iliad or 
Odyssey.”—Mure, “History of Greek Literature,” vol. i. p. 478, sq.</p>

compared with infinitude, they are on an equal footing with

<p class="tei tei-p c13">It has been observed that the annual procession
 of the sacred ship so often represented on Egyptian monuments, and the 
return of the deity from Ethiopia after some days’ absence, serves to 
show the Ethiopian origin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter 
Ammon. “I think,” says Heeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus 
about the holy ship, “that this procession is represented in one of the 
great sculptured reliefs on the temple of Karnak. The sacred ship of 
Ammon is on the shore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by 
another boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must have been one of 
the most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the 
interpretation of antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of 
Jupiter’s visit to the Ethiopians, and his twelve days’ absence.”—Long, 
“Egyptian Antiquities” vol. 1 p. 96. Eustathius, vol. 1 p. 98, sq. (ed. 
Basil) gives this interpretation, and likewise an allegorical one, which
 we will spare the reader.</p>

Thersites, revolting and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to 
develop the disposition of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning
 is less prominent. Of the gradual and individual development of Homer’s
 heroes, Schlegel well observes, “In bas-relief the figures are usually 
in profile, and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner
 in relief; they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so 
Homer’s heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has been
 remarked that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">Iliad</span></span>
 is not definitively closed, but that we are left to suppose something 
both to precede and to follow it. The bas-relief is equally without 
limit, and may be continued <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c15">ad infinitum,</span></span>
 either from before or behind, on which account the ancients preferred 
for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension, sacrificial
 processions, dances, and lines of combatants, and hence they also 
exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as vases, or the frieze of a
 rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two ends are withdrawn from our 
sight, and where, while we advance, one object appears as another 
disappears. Reading Homer is very much like such a circuit; the present 
object alone arresting our attention, we lose sight of what precedes, 
and do not concern ourselves about what is to follow.”—“Dramatic

The fate which awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent

attested even more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon

 To Ceres a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to 
Bacchus, because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and
 to Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were 
to be appeased with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices

 be perfect in every limb, healthy, and without blemish.”—“Elgin

 or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising, according to Strabo, on 
the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same hill with the Granicus and

identify it with Mendere, as Wood, Rennell, and others maintain; the 
Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet broad, deep in the time of flood, 
nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke successfully combats the opinion of
 those who make the Scamander to have arisen from the springs of 
Bounabarshy, and traces the source of the river to the highest mountain 
in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy; receives the Simois in its course; 
towards its mouth it is very muddy, and flows through marshes. Between 
the Scamander and Simois, Homer’s Troy is supposed to have stood: this 
river, according to Homer, was called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by 
men. The waters of the Scamander had the singular property of giving a 
beautiful colour to the hair or wool of such animals as bathed in them; 
hence the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before
 they appeared before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name 
Xanthus, “yellow,” was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour 
of its waters, still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of 
whose waters attracts the attention of travellers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">“The Catalogue is, perhaps, the portion of the 
poem in favour of which a claim to separate authorship has been most 
plausibly urged. Although the example of Homer has since rendered some 
such formal enumeration of the forces engaged, a common practice in epic
 poems descriptive of great warlike adventures, still so minute a 
statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required, 
nor perhaps such as would, in ordinary cases, suggest itself to the mind
 of a poet. Yet there is scarcely any portion of the Iliad where both 
historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a 
connection from the remotest period, with the remainder of the work. The
 composition of the Catalogue, whensoever it may have taken place, 
necessarily presumes its author’s acquaintance with a previously 
existing Iliad. It were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony 
observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper names, most 
of them historically unimportant, and not a few altogether fictitious: 
or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in 
these few hundred lines, and incidentally scattered over the thousands 
which follow: equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring 
in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text, 
several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety, but through 
the medium of the Iliad.”—Mure, “Language and Literature of Greece,”

 “Thucydides observes that the Boeotian vessels, which carried one 
hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant to be the largest in 
the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying fifty each, the smallest. 
The average would be eighty-five, and Thucydides supposes the troops to 
have rowed and navigated themselves; and that very few, besides the 
chiefs, went as mere passengers or landsmen. In short, we have in the 
Homeric descriptions the complete picture of an Indian or African war 
canoe, many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale 
assigned to those of the Greeks. If the total number of the Greek ships 
be taken at twelve hundred, according to Thucydides, although in point 
of fact there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six in the Catalogue, 
the amount of the army, upon the foregoing average, will be about a 
hundred and two thousand men. The historian considers this a small force
 as representing all Greece. Bryant, comparing it with the allied army 
at Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the entire falsehood of the 
whole story; and his reasonings and calculations are, for their 
curiosity, well worth a careful perusal.”—Coleridge, p. 211, sq.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">The early epic was largely occupied with the 
exploits and sufferings of women, or heroines, the wives and daughters 
of the Grecian heroes. A nation of courageous, hardy, indefatigable 
women, dwelling apart from men, permitting only a short temporary 
intercourse, for the purpose of renovating their numbers, burning out 
their right breast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow 
freely; this was at once a general type, stimulating to the fancy of the
 poet, and a theme eminently popular with his hearers. We find these 
warlike females constantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and 
universally accepted as past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes 
to illustrate emphatically the most numerous host in which he ever found
 himself included, he tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia, on the 
banks of the Sangarius, for the purpose of resisting the formidable 
Amazons. When Bellerophon is to be employed in a deadly and perilous 
undertaking, by those who prudently wished to procure his death, he is 
despatched against the Amazons.—Grote, vol. i p. 289.</p>

 “The halls of Alkinous and Menelaus glitter with gold, copper, and 
electrum; while large stocks of yet unemployed metal—gold, copper, and 
iron are stored up in the treasure-chamber of Odysseus and other chiefs.
 Coined money is unknown in the Homeric age—the trade carried on being 
one of barter. In reference also to the metals, it deserves to be 
remarked, that the Homeric descriptions universally suppose copper, and 
not iron, to be employed for arms, both offensive and defensive. By what
 process the copper was tempered and hardened, so as to serve the 
purpose of the warrior, we do not know; but the use of iron for these 
objects belongs to a later age.”—Grote, vol. ii. p. 142.</p>

“The poet’s method of introducing his episode, also, illustrates in a 
curious manner his tact in the dramatic department of his art. Where, 
for example, one or more heroes are despatched on some commission, to be
 executed at a certain distance of time or place, the fulfilment of this
 task is not, as a general rule, immediately described. A certain 
interval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action, 
which interval is dramatised, as it were, either by a temporary 
continuation of the previous narrative, or by fixing attention for a 
while on some new transaction, at the close of which the further account
 of the mission is resumed.”</p>

indignation to which Hector alludes, when he regrets that the Trojans 
had not spirit enough to cover Paris with a mantle of stones. This, 
however, was also one of the ordinary formal modes of punishment for 
great public offences. It may have been originally connected with the 
same feeling—the desire of avoiding the pollution of bloodshed—which 
seems to have suggested the practice of burying prisoners alive, with a 
scantling of food by their side. Though Homer makes no mention of this 
horrible usage, the example of the Roman Vestals affords reasons for 
believing that, in ascribing it to the heroic ages, Sophocles followed 
an authentic tradition.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p. 171, sq.</p>

 “With respect to the private dwellings, which are oftenest described, 
the poet’s language barely enables us to form a general notion of their 
ordinary plan, and affords no conception of the style which prevailed in
 them or of their effect on the eye. It seems indeed probable, from the 
manner in which he dwells on their metallic ornaments that the higher 
beauty of proportion was but little required or understood, and it is, 
perhaps, strength and convenience, rather than elegance, that he means 
to commend, in speaking of the fair house which Paris had built for 
himself with the aid of the most skilful masons of Troy.”—Thirlwall’s

 “Another essential basis of mechanical unity in the poem is the 
construction of the rampart. This takes place in the seventh book. The 
reason ascribed for the glaring improbability that the Greeks should 
have left their camp and fleet unfortified during nine years, in the 
midst of a hostile country, is a purely poetical one: ‘So long as 
Achilles fought, the terror of his name sufficed to keep every foe at a 
distance.’ The disasters consequent on his secession first led to the 
necessity of other means of protection. Accordingly, in the battles 
previous to the eighth book, no allusion occurs to a rampart; in all 
those which follow it forms a prominent feature. Here, then, in the 
anomaly as in the propriety of the Iliad, the destiny of Achilles, or 
rather this peculiar crisis of it, forms the pervading bond of connexion
 to the whole poem.”—Mure, vol. i., p. 257.</p>

commencement of the eighth book, against any further interference of the
 gods in the battles. In the opening of the twentieth book this

<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Some of the epithets which Homer applies to 
the heavens seem to imply that he considered it as a solid vault of 
metal. But it is not necessary to construe these epithets so literally, 
nor to draw any such inference from his description of Atlas, who holds 
the lofty pillars which keep earth and heaven asunder. Yet it would 
seem, from the manner in which the height of heaven is compared with the
 depth of Tartarus, that the region of light was thought to have certain
 bounds. The summit of the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the 
highest point on the earth, and it is not always carefully distinguished
 from the aerian regions above The idea of a seat of the gods—perhaps 
derived from a more ancient tradition, in which it was not attached to 
any geographical site—seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet’s 
mind with that of the real mountain.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p.

(Herodot. iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, ‘The 
feudal aids are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time
 answered the purpose.’ (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p. 189) This
 fact frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato, 
however, (De Rep. vi. 4), says, “We cannot commend Phoenix, the tutor of
 Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of 
presents and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to desist 
from his wrath, nor again, should we commend Achilles himself, or

Parnassus and Helicon” (Grote, vol. p. 181), was a sufficient reason for
 its prosperity and decay. “As long as the channels of these waters were
 diligently watched and kept clear, a large portion of the lake was in 
the condition of alluvial land, pre-eminently rich and fertile. But when
 the channels came to be either neglected, or designedly choked up by an
 enemy, the water accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the soil of

 The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall (Greece, vol. i, p. 176 
seq.) well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting between
 these two heroes—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“One of the noblest and most amiable sides of 
the Greek character, is the readiness with which it lent itself to 
construct intimate and durable friendships, and this is a feature no 
less prominent in the earliest than in later times. It was indeed 
connected with the comparatively low estimation in which female society 
was held; but the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments
 were maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic 
companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in 
traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the same 
feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or 
object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to die for one 
another. It is true that the relation between them is not always one of 
perfect equality; but this is a circumstance which, while it often adds a
 peculiar charm to the poetical description, detracts little from the 
dignity of the idea which it presents. Such were the friendships of 
Hercules and Iolaus, of Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; 
and though These may owe the greater part of their fame to the later 
epic or even dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted
 in the period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the
 Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose 
love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher 
birth and his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard which united 
Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons 
themselves are less important, it is kept more in the back-ground, is 
manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light. The idea of a Greek 
hero seems not to have been thought complete, without such a brother in 
arms by his side.”—Thirlwall, Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.</p>

 the mythology, also, of the Iliad, purely Pagan as it is, we discover 
one important truth unconsciously involved, which was almost entirely 
lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of 
subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent.
 No distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the 
father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable. This seems to be 
the true character of the Homeric deity, and it is very necessary that 
the student of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind. A 
strong instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the 
passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon.
 ‘Alas me!’ says he ‘since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to
 me of men, should be slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, 
my heart is divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether 
having snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not 
at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether
 I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius!’ To 
which Juno answers—‘Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man, 
long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it—but we, 
the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.’ Here it is clear from both 
speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter 
might still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of the 
reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that Jupiter 
himself would destroy him by the hands of another.”—Coleridge, p. 156.

 “The art military of the Homeric age is upon a level with the state of 
navigation just described, personal prowess decided every thing; the 
night attack and the ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never upon a
 large scale. The chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as 
the knights of romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern 
siege as a captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention 
of a ditch or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself
 was accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth 
with a declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The 
Trojans are in no respects blockaded, and receive assistance from their 
allies to the very end.”—Coleridge, p. 212.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">Coleridge (Greek Classic Poets, p. 182, seq.) 
has diligently compared this with the description of the shield of 
Hercules by Hesiod. He remarks that, “with two or three exceptions, the 
imagery differs in little more than the names and arrangements; and the 
difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for 
the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no 
exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work. 
The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or 
congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs 
and Lapithae;— but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with 
the Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence 
however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images 
of war, over an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the 
fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net, 
are minutely represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the 
leading remark is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at 
sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the 
genuineness of this poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in 
the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is 
decisive—while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, 
that the Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.”</p>

Hellenes,—a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by Zeus,
 yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the commands 
of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His recompense is reserved to 
the close of his career, when his afflicting trials are brought to a 
close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and receives in marriage

<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into 
this region of poetical fancy is the collision into which, in the 
twenty-first of the Iliad, he has brought the river god Scamander, first
 with Achilles, and afterwards with Vulcan, when summoned by Juno to the
 hero’s aid. The overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural 
interpretation in the character of the mountain torrents of Greece and 
Asia Minor. Their wide, shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry, so
 as to be easily forded by the foot passenger. But a thunder-shower in 
the mountains, unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain, may 
suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river. The rescue of 
Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready 
explanation from physical causes. Yet the subsiding of the flood at the 
critical moment when the hero’s destruction appeared imminent, might, by
 a slight extension of the figurative parallel, be ascribed to a god 
symbolic of the influences opposed to all atmospheric moisture.”—Mure,

<p class="tei tei-p c13">In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of Coleridge are well worth reading:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“By a close study of life, and by a true and 
natural mode of expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon
 the most peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself 
from them with the completest success. The whole scene between Achilles 
and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of 
redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly skilful, 
and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad. 
Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of Priam, the 
rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if genius did not 
often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle 
precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this account alone, to 
consider the last book of the Iliad as what is called spurious, in other
 words, of later date than the rest of the poem. Observe the exquisite 
taste of Priam in occupying the mind of Achilles, from the outset, with 
the image of his father; in gradually introducing the parallel of his 
own situation; and, lastly, mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives 
that the hero is softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter 
the pride of the conqueror. The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato 
aecha geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the
 Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage defies 
translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no name, but 
which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in 
the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another 
language.”—Coleridge, p. 195.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_296" id="note_296" class="pginternal">296.</a></dt>
<dd class="tei tei-notetext">
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of
 Hector cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of 
humanity. The heroic age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws.
 Retributive vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty 
inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only 
taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the 
injured man; but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on 
the fate of the body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the 
rites essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions 
of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary 
shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to
 Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows how 
efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been
 in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death, was 
supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding up the 
body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even this
 partial cession of his just rights of retribution.”—Mure, vol. i. 289.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of Helen’s character—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“Few things are more interesting than to 
observe how the same hand that has given us the fury and inconsistency 
of Achilles, gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of 
Helen. She is through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and 
speech, noble in her associations, full of remorse for a fault for which
 higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate towards 
those with whom that fault had committed her. I have always thought the 
following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and hints at her own 
invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest 
passage in the poem. It is another striking instance of that refinement 
of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last 
book of the Iliad from the rest.”—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_299" id="note_299" class="pginternal">299.</a></dt>
<dd class="tei tei-notetext">
<p class="tei tei-p c13">“And here we part with Achilles at the moment 
best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character. We 
had accompanied him through the effervescence, undulations, and final 
subsidence of his stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under 
the full influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration 
of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few
 short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be 
suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c13">The frequent and touching allusions, 
interspersed throughout the Iliad, to the speedy termination of its 
hero’s course, and the moral on the vanity of human life which they 
indicate, are among the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by
 which the whole framework of the poem is united.”—Mure, vol. i. p 201.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c13">Cowper says,—“I cannot take my leave of this 
noble poem without expressing how much I am struck with the plain 
conclusion of it. It is like the exit of a great man out of company, 
whom he has entertained magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not
 contemptuous, yet without much ceremony.” Coleridge, p. 227, considers 
the termination of “Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.</p>

<div class="c39">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free 
distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest 
variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new 
computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers 
and donations from people in all walks of life.</div>
<div class="c2">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers 
with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project 
Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection 
will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the 
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a 
secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future 
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 
Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 
and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</div>
<div class="c39">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>
<div class="c2">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 
non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of
 the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal 
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification 
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by 
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</div>
<div class="c2">The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North
 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact 
links and up to date contact information can be found at the 
Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</div>
<div class="c39">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive 
without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission
 of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can 
be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest 
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations 
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt 
status with the IRS.</div>
<div class="c2">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws 
regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the 
United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a 
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up 
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where 
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND 
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
 visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from 
states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of 
no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in 
such states who approach us with offers to donate.</div>
<div class="c2">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we 
cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations 
received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small
 staff.</div>
<div class="c2">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current
 donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of 
other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. 
To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</div>
<div class="c39">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div>
<div class="c2">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the 
Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could 
be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and 
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of 
volunteer support.</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several
 printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by 
copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do
 not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper 
edition.</div>
<div class="c2">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">This website includes information about Project 
Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg 
Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how
 to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</div>
